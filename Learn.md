Its flexibility and simplicity make it a popular choice for both small projects and large-scale applications. Additionally, the extensive ecosystem of plugins and middleware available for Express.js helps developers quickly add functionality and enhance their applications.

### Setting a local server with express js
   To set up a local server with Express.js, follow these steps:
   1. Install Node.js and npm: Download and install Node.js, which includes npm.
   2. Create a project directory:
       mkdir my-express-app
       cd my-express-app
   3. Initialize a new Node.js project:
      npm init -y
   4. Install Express.js:
      npm install express
   5. Create a basic server:
      - Create a file named app.js:
        
    const express = require('express');
    const app = express();  
    const port = 3000;
    app.get('/', (req, res) => {
    res.send('Hello, World!');
    });
    app.listen(port, () => {
    console.log(`Server is running at http://localhost:${port}`);
    });

   6. Run the server:
      `node app.js`
      
   7. Access the server: Open a web browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000. You should see "Hello, World!" displayed.   
 
### How can you run local server to test your application frontend

 To run a local server for both frontend and backend development:
1. Start the backend server:
   node backend/app.js

2. Run a local server for the frontend (e.g., using http-server or create-react-app):
   cd frontend
   http-server -p 3001
   
3. Ensure backend (e.g., at http://localhost:3000) and frontend (e.g., at http://localhost:3001) servers are running. Configure frontend to communicate with the backend API.  

### Swagger
Swagger, an open-source framework, simplifies the development and documentation of RESTful APIs. Through the OpenAPI specification, it standardizes API description, facilitating automated generation of interactive documentation.
