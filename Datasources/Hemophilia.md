# Hemophilia

## Introduction
Hemophilia is a genetic disorder that affects the blood's ability to clot. This condition is often inherited and can lead to excessive bleeding, both externally and internally, even from minor injuries. Hemophilia is primarily found in males but can also affect females to a lesser extent. The condition is classified based on the specific clotting factor that is deficient, with Hemophilia A and Hemophilia B being the most common types.

## Causes
Hemophilia is caused by a deficiency or absence of certain clotting factors in the blood, which are proteins that help blood clot properly. The most common forms are:

- **Hemophilia A:** Caused by a deficiency of factor VIII.
- **Hemophilia B:** Caused by a deficiency of factor IX.

This deficiency is usually inherited through a genetic mutation on the X chromosome.

## Symptoms
The symptoms of hemophilia can vary depending on the severity of the condition. Common symptoms include:

- Excessive bleeding from cuts or injuries
- Frequent nosebleeds
- Easy bruising
- Pain and swelling in the joints due to internal bleeding


### Hemophilia Symptoms in Babies and Children
In babies and children, hemophilia may manifest as:

- Unexplained irritability or fussiness (possibly due to internal bleeding)
- Large bruises from minor bumps or falls
- Prolonged bleeding after vaccinations or minor injuries
- Swelling in the joints, leading to difficulty moving or using the limb

### Bleeding into the Brain
A severe and rare complication of hemophilia is bleeding into the brain. Even a simple bump on the head can cause this in individuals with severe hemophilia. Symptoms of bleeding into the brain include:

- Painful, prolonged headache
- Repeated vomiting
- Sleepiness or lethargy
- Double vision
- Sudden weakness or clumsiness
- Convulsions or seizures

## When to See a Doctor
Seek emergency care if you or your child experiences:

- Signs or symptoms of bleeding into the brain
- An injury where the bleeding won’t stop
- Swollen joints that are hot to the touch and painful to bend

## Types of Hemophilia
There are different types of hemophilia, primarily:

- **Hemophilia A:** Also known as classical hemophilia, caused by a deficiency in factor VIII.
- **Hemophilia B:** Also known as Christmas disease, caused by a deficiency in factor IX.
- **Hemophilia C:** A rare form caused by a deficiency in factor XI, affecting both sexes.

## Risk Factors
Hemophilia is usually inherited, meaning it is passed from parents to their children through their genes. However, in rare cases, a person can develop hemophilia later in life due to an autoimmune condition where the body attacks its own clotting factors.

## Can People Develop Hemophilia?
Yes, though it's rare. Acquired hemophilia can develop when the body’s immune system mistakenly attacks clotting factors in the blood. This is not inherited and can occur due to autoimmune conditions, cancer, or during pregnancy.

## Is Hemophilia a Common Disease?
No, hemophilia is not common. According to the CDC, about 33,000 people in the U.S. have hemophilia. It mainly affects men, but women can also be affected, especially if they have extremely low levels of clotting factors.

## Is Hemophilia a Serious Illness?
Yes, hemophilia can be serious, especially if left untreated. It can lead to severe complications like uncontrolled bleeding, joint damage, and in rare cases, bleeding into the brain, which can be life-threatening.

## How Do People Inherit Hemophilia?
Hemophilia A and B are inherited in an X-linked recessive pattern:

- Males (with one X and one Y chromosome) who inherit the faulty X chromosome will have hemophilia.
- Females (with two X chromosomes) who inherit one faulty X chromosome typically do not have symptoms because the other X chromosome provides normal clotting factors. However, they can pass the faulty gene to their children.

### Do Women Ever Develop Hemophilia Symptoms?
Women can develop symptoms if they carry the hemophilia gene and have low clotting factor levels. Symptoms may include heavy menstrual periods, easy bruising, and bleeding issues after childbirth.

### What Are Clotting Factor Levels?
Clotting factor levels help determine the severity of hemophilia:

- **Mild Hemophilia:** 5% to 30% of normal clotting factor levels.
- **Moderate Hemophilia:** 1% to 5% of normal levels.
- **Severe Hemophilia:** Less than 1% of normal clotting factor levels.

## Diagnosis of Hemophilia
Hemophilia is diagnosed through blood tests that measure the level of clotting factors. These tests help determine if a person has hemophilia and the severity of the condition.

## Prevention of Hemophilia
Hemophilia is a genetic disorder and cannot be prevented. However, genetic counseling can help families understand their risks of passing the condition on to their children.

## What is the Life Expectancy for Someone with Hemophilia?
According to the World Federation of Hemophilia, people with hemophilia have a life expectancy that is about 10 years shorter than those without the condition. However, with proper treatment, children diagnosed with hemophilia can have a normal life expectancy.

## Living With Hemophilia

### How Do I Take Care of Myself?
Living with hemophilia involves ongoing medical care, avoiding certain activities and medications, and making lifestyle adjustments to manage the condition.

#### Activities to Avoid
People with hemophilia should avoid activities that pose a high risk of injury, such as:

- Football, hockey, or rugby
- Boxing or wrestling
- Riding motorcycles or skateboards

#### Medications to Avoid
Avoid pain medications like aspirin, ibuprofen, and naproxen, as well as anticoagulants like heparin or warfarin, as these can increase bleeding risks.

#### Activities and Actions to Improve Quality of Life
- **Exercise:** Regular exercise, with guidance from a healthcare provider, can help maintain joint health and overall fitness.
- **Manage Stress:** Hemophilia is a lifelong condition, so finding ways to manage stress and balance daily obligations is essential.
- **Dental Hygiene:** Good dental care helps prevent the need for procedures that may cause bleeding.
- **Maintain a Healthy Weight:** Managing weight can reduce stress on joints, especially if joint damage has occurred from past bleeds.
- **Educate Others:** Ensure that family, caregivers, and school officials are informed about hemophilia and know how to respond in an emergency.

## How is Hemophilia Detected?
Hemophilia is detected through specific blood tests that measure clotting factor levels. These tests help identify which clotting factors are deficient and the severity of the condition.

## Why is Hemophilia Called the "Royal Disease"?
Hemophilia is sometimes called the "royal disease" because it was present in European royal families during the 19th and 20th centuries. Queen Victoria of England was a carrier of hemophilia B, passing it to several of her descendants.

## Is Hemophilia a Lifelong Disease?
Yes, hemophilia is a lifelong condition that cannot be cured. However, with appropriate treatment, the condition can be managed effectively, allowing individuals to lead full lives.

## Is Hemophilia Painful?
Yes, hemophilia can be painful, especially when internal bleeding occurs in the joints or muscles. Managing pain is an essential part of living with the condition.

## What is the Latest Treatment for Hemophilia?
The latest treatment for hemophilia is **Roctavian™,** a gene therapy approved by the FDA in June 2023 for treating severe hemophilia A (factor VIII deficiency) in adults. Gene therapy offers a promising approach to potentially reducing the frequency of bleeding episodes.

## Conclusion
Hemophilia is a serious, lifelong condition that requires careful management. With advancements in medical care and treatments, individuals with hemophilia can lead healthy and active lives. Early diagnosis, proper treatment, and lifestyle adjustments are key to managing hemophilia and minimizing its impact on daily life.
