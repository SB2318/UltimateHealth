## Abstract

The gut microbiome may be both helpful and harmful, and not only is it affected by diet, it has also been shown to affect mental health including personality, mood, anxiety and depression. In this clinical study we assessed dietary nutrient composition, mood, happiness, and the gut microbiome in order to understand the role of diet in the gut microbiome and how that affects mood and happiness. For this pilot study, we enrolled 20 adults to follow this protocol: recording a 2-day food log, sampling their gut microbiome, and completing five validated surveys of mental health, mood, happiness and well-being, followed by a minimum 1 week diet change and repeating the food log, microbiome sampling and the 5 surveys. The change from a predominantly Western diet to vegetarian, Mediterranean and ketogenic diets led to changes in calorie and fiber intake. After the diet change, we observed significant changes in measures of anxiety, well-being and happiness, and without changes in gut microbiome diversity. We found strong correlations between greater consumption of fat and protein to lower anxiety and depression, while consuming higher percentages of carbohydrates was associated with increased stress, anxiety, and depression. We also found strong negative correlations between total calories and total fiber intake with gut microbiome diversity without correlations to measures of mental health, mood or happiness. We have shown that changing diet affects mood and happiness, that greater fat and carbohydrate intake is directly associated with anxiety and depression and inversely correlated with gut microbiome diversity. This study is an important step towards understanding how our diet affects the gut microbiome and in turn our mood, happiness and mental health.

## Gut health and anxiety

Given how closely the gut and brain interact, it becomes easier to understand why you might feel nauseated before giving a presentation, or feel intestinal pain during times of stress. That doesn't mean, however, that functional gastrointestinal conditions are imagined or "all in your head." Psychology combines with physical factors to cause pain and other bowel symptoms. Psychosocial factors influence the actual physiology of the gut, as well as symptoms. In other words, stress (or depression or other psychological factors) can affect movement and contractions of the GI tract.

In addition, many people with functional GI disorders perceive pain more acutely than other people do because their brains are more responsive to pain signals from the GI tract. Stress can make the existing pain seem even worse.

Based on these observations, you might expect that at least some patients with functional GI conditions might improve with therapy to reduce stress or treat anxiety or depression. Multiple studies have found that psychologically based approaches lead to greater improvement in digestive symptoms compared with only conventional medical treatment.

### Introduction

The complex interplay between the foods we eat and how our brains react to nutrition highlights the interconnectedness of daily lifestyle habits and the health of the brain, mind, and body. Understanding the relationship between food and its impact on mental/brain health, in conjunction with the reciprocal influence of mental/brain health on whole-body health, including gut health, and daily lifestyle habits, such as dietary choices, requires a transdisciplinary approach that incorporates the fields of psychiatry, psychology, neuroscience, nutrition, and lifestyle medicine (1–4). This review will explore the significant impact of nutrition on brain health, mental well-being, and cognitive functioning. It will highlight the emerging role of lifestyle interventions and nutritional neuroscience in proactively improving patient outcomes and managing mental/brain health conditions.

The brain has the greatest metabolic demands (approximately 20–25% of the body’s total energy consumption) of any human organ (5). Additionally, optimal brain health requires various nutrients, including carbohydrates, essential fatty acids, proteins, vitamins, and minerals (6, 7). Glucose derived from carbohydrates is the primary source of energy for the brain. Essential fatty acids (e.g., omega-3 fatty acids, omega-6 fatty acids) play a critical role in maintaining the integrity of structures in the brain, as well as promoting the synthesis and functioning of neurotransmitters and components of the immune system (8). Finally, amino acids found in protein foods, including tryptophan, tyrosine, histidine, and arginine, are also utilized by the brain to produce neurotransmitters and neuromodulatory compounds (9). Research surrounding the link between nutrition and mental/brain health issues has transitioned from an initial focus on nutrient deficiencies that manifested observable psychiatric and/or neurological symptoms in clinical settings (i.e., the lack of thiamine and the potential development of Wernicke syndrome) to a prioritization of research inquiries aiming to better understand the implications of comprehensive dietary patterns on human well-being in the context of both health and disease (4).

Evidence in the burgeoning fields of lifestyle psychiatry and nutritional neuroscience has made it increasingly evident that diet is not only a matter of physical sustenance but also a fundamental factor influencing cognitive abilities, emotional states, and risk of or protection against mental health issues and/or brain illnesses (4, 10–13). This bidirectional relationship challenges the historical silos of nutrition and neuroscience, emphasizing the need for transdisciplinary collaboration to unravel the intricacies of how the foods we consume shape the functioning of our brains and, in turn, how the state of our brains influences our dietary choices.

### Gut-brain connection, anxiety and digestion

The stomach or intestinal problems — such as heartburn, abdominal cramps, or loose stools — related to stress? Watch for these and other common symptoms of stress and discuss them with your doctor. Together you can come up with strategies to help you deal with the stressors in your life, and also ease your digestive discomforts.

## Intersection of nutrition and mental health

The intersection between nutrition and mental health is an emerging area of research interest. For the purpose of this paper, we will focus on depression since the data is more complete and depression is projected to be one of the top health concerns by 2030. Despite growing medications and therapeutics, the negative impact of depression continues to grow as reflected by the increase in disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs), years lived with disability (YLDs), and years of life lost (YLLs).

**Five theories of neuropathology of depression**


In their 2016 review, Loonen and Ivanona postulated five theories regarding the neuropathology of depression. First is the well known monoamine theory. The majority of psychotropic medications that have FDA approval for the treatment of depression (e.g., selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, or tricyclic acids) modulate serotonin, as such, the monoamine theory links the origins of depression to deficits of serotonin. Currently, this has been expanded to include norepinephrine and dopamine as well. Second is the biorhythm theory, which centers on sleep disruption and altercations within the REM sleep and deep sleep patterns. A dysfunctional sleep rhythm alters the natural circadian rhythm that is regulated within the nucleus suprachiasmaticus (SCN), It is hypothesized that the altered circadian rhythm within the SCN contributes to mood dysregulation patterns throughout the day.

Third is the neuro-endocrine hypothesis. Thyroid levels, particularly, hypothyroidism has been linked with the onset of depressive symptoms . Changes in thyroid hormones have been linked with serotonin insufficiency . As will be discussed in more detail, dysregulation within the HPA, particularly higher levels of cortisol have been linked with altercations of the circadian rhythm, hippocampus, and limbic system, which may account for changes of emotions seen in depression. Individuals with depression also as a whole have higher levels of cortisol in the mornings and evenings compared to non-depressed individuals. The fourth is the neuro-immune hypothesis, which also will be discussed in more detail. The HPA axis and the immune system are significantly interconnected, and changes with cortisol levels can greatly impact the immune system. Changes within neurohormones or other triggers cause the release of neurotrophic factors, like BDNF, regulatory cytokines, etc., which have been linked with changes in the hippocampus, limbic system, SCN and have been linked with depression. Finally, the fifth is the kindling hypothesis, which states that the actual illness causes cell death and reinforces depressive symptoms with progressive worsening symptoms.

In the 2021 review, Marx et al., show dietary patterns, commonly known as the Western Diet or Standard American Diet, which are high in saturated fats, refined carbohydrates and ultra-processed foods, can create many of the Loonen and Ivanona hypotheses . A systematic analysis of the Global Burden of Disease Study assessing the health effects of dietary risks in 195 countries from 1990 to 2017 found that diet-related risk factors were responsible for approximately one-fourth of all deaths among adults and almost one-fifth of all disability-adjusted life years among adults. Particularly concerning is the increasing consumption of UPF. Prior to COVID-19 pandemic, the typical U.S. diet consisted of about 60% UPF. The consumption patterns were consistent between gender and race, and the global consumption of UPF has increased in the post-pandemic era. UPF contains excessively high levels of refined sugars, saturated fat, trans-fat, caffeine, and sodium, with regards to both overall macro- and micronutrient content and energy density, as well as very low levels of dietary fiber.

## Brain health, mental health, and wellness

While mental health is known by both the public and scientific community, it does not capture the importance of the concept of brain health. Brain health is defined by the WHO as the fostering of optimal brain development, cognitive health, and well-being throughout the entire lifespan . As such, brain health includes what is thought, done, said, and felt. The lifespan continuum of brain health is also in alignment with current evidence regarding neuroplasticity, the ability of the brain to adapt and escape previous genomic restrictions through the formation and reorganization of synaptic connections.

Brain health includes the concepts of wellness, mental health, and brain health (see Figure for a representation of the relationship between wellness, mental health, and brain health). With this framework in mind, it is important to note how dietary choices across the lifespan have the potential to positively alter brain structure and improve brain health or negatively impact it.

### Nutrition and brain changes across the lifespan
The brain and body are exposed to a wide array of exogenous and endogenous stimuli that can impart various levels of functionality across biopsychosocial spheres of health, which determine both short- and long-term outcomes across the lifespan. A healthy early life development of the BGM system helps prevent later disease development. Nutritional programming is the concept that key cells within the body will be able to absorb nutrients or synthesize them de novo in key periods of time to support early life development. Multiple nutrients with epigenetic potential that are present in the diet or produced via microbial metabolism in the human gut. The B-complex vitamins, SCFAs, and polyphenols are among nutrients known to exert epigenetic effects on the host. Significant synaptogenesis in the brain occurs simultaneous to diversification of gut bacteria during critical windows. Critical windows are periods of development during which the phenotypic outcomes (e.g., intelligence quotient) of an individual are remarkably sensitive to interactions between environmental and genetic factors. Environmental factors, such as diet, can significantly alter the developmental course of high-plasticity bodily systems, such as the central nervous system, cardiovascular system, gastrointestinal system, and immune system . As such, within the nutritional framework, nutrients need to be available for optimal development .

## Future directions related to the gut microbiota, nutrition, and mental health
Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, it was estimated that 50% of the United States experienced loneliness . Following the pandemic, the impact of loneliness has increased. More adolescents report loneliness and isolation and chronic illness. Although there is not a direct correlation between isolation, chronic illness and mental health, those who experience isolation report having increasing mental health symptoms . Based on world events, social injustice, and worsening socioeconomic factors, it seems unlikely that these trends will reverse. Although it may seem trivial in the wake of these factors to focus on the BGM system and nutrition, this effort may have more of a global impact. In addition to the mental health symptoms as outlined, dietary choices are the largest driver of chronic illness. The health industry promotes protein as the optimal food ingredient to reverse these trends and overlooks the importance of fiber. As a result, less than 5% of Americans are consuming an adequate dose of fiber, which has been key in developing and maintaining a healthy BGM-system .

Traditionally, healthcare professionals receive very little evidence-based nutrition didactics during their formal education. The reasons vary from nutrition being a “soft science,” or there is “too much controversy over the nutrition literature,” or there is “only time to teach what is on licensing exams.” To ensure that healthcare providers receive this vital training, licensure boards need to incorporate questions regarding plant-based nutrition and the importance of the BGM system. Additionally, we encourage other medical organizations to follow the Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Psychiatrists and World Federation of Society for Biological Psychiatry and adopt lifestyle guidelines within their mental recommendations.

## What Does Your Gut’s Brain Control?

Unlike the big brain in your skull, the ENS can’t balance your checkbook or compose a love note. Its main role is controlling digestion, from swallowing to the release of enzymes that break down food to the control of blood flow that helps with nutrient absorption to elimination. The enteric nervous system doesn’t seem capable of thought as we know it, but it communicates back and forth with our big brain—with profound results.

The ENS may trigger big emotional shifts experienced by people coping with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and functional bowel problems such as constipation, diarrhea, bloating, pain and stomach upset. For decades, researchers and doctors thought that anxiety and depression contributed to these problems. But our studies and others show that it may also be the other way around. Researchers are finding evidence that irritation in the gastrointestinal system may send signals to the central nervous system (CNS) that trigger mood changes.

These new findings may explain why a higher-than-normal percentage of people with IBS and functional bowel problems develop depression and anxiety. That’s important data, because up to 30% to 40% of the population has functional bowel problems at some point.

## New Gut Understanding Equals New Treatment Opportunities

This understanding of the ENS-CNS connection helps explain the effectiveness of IBS and bowel-disorder treatments such as antidepressants and mind-body therapies like cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and medical hypnotherapy. Researchers say our two brains ”talk” to each other, so therapies that help one may help the other. In a way, gastroenterologists (doctors who specialize in digestive conditions) are like counselors looking for ways to soothe the second brain.

Gastroenterologists may prescribe certain antidepressants for IBS, for example—not because they think the problem is all in a patient’s head, but because these medications calm symptoms in some cases by acting on nerve cells in the gut. Psychological interventions like CBT may also help to “improve communications” between the big brain and the brain in our gut.

## How to support your gut and brain health

Scientists are learning how to tweak gut bacteria to manage certain diseases. There are already some healthy probiotic supplements that may help with disease management, but the puzzle is far from complete (see “what about probiotic supplements?” below).  

Until science has more answers, a great way to support brain and gut health is with these four healthy lifestyle habits:

1. **A nutritious eating plan:** A healthy microbiome thrives when your diet has lots of variety and is high in fibre, which comes from vegetables, fruit, legumes, whole grains, nuts and seeds. A fibre-rich, plant-based diet is good for heart health, brain health and the microbiome. Research also shows that these foods help maintain a healthy microbiome:

- Omega-3 rich fish such as salmon, trout and mackerel
- Foods rich in polyphenols such as berries, olive oil and green tea
- Fermented foods such as yogurt, kimchi, kombucha and sauerkraut

Alcohol, artificial sweeteners, red meat, sugar and excessive amounts of ultra-processed foods can harm the microbiome and should be limited.

2. **Regular physical activity:** Exercise is linked to a lower risk of heart disease and a healthier microbiome. Aim for at least 150 minutes per week of aerobic exercise, and work on muscle strength at least twice a week using resistance bands or free weights.

3. **Stress management:** Having high levels of chronic stress can change the microbiome, including a reduction in good bacteria. Taking regular breaks to do things you enjoy can help manage stress. Try walking outdoors in nature, meeting a friend, watching a funny video or doing a hobby that you love.

4. **Sufficient sleep:** Persistent sleep deprivation can damage the microbiome and has been linked to heart disease. Aim for seven to eight hours of sleep per night. Having trouble getting enough zzzs? Follow the healthy lifestyle tips above and add:

   - A consistent bedtime
   - A quiet dark room
   - Turning off devices an hour before bed
   - Avoiding large meals before bed
   - No caffeine eight hours before bedtime
   - No more than 1-2 alcohol drinks per week


## Conclusion 

In conclusion, the intricate relationship between diet and mental health, often referred to as the gut-brain connection, underscores the profound impact of nutrition on our overall well-being. A balanced diet rich in whole foods, including fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean proteins, and healthy fats, fosters a diverse and healthy gut microbiome, which in turn supports optimal brain function and mental health. Conversely, diets high in processed foods, sugars, and unhealthy fats can disrupt gut health and contribute to mental health issues such as anxiety and depression. Emerging research continues to reveal the complex interactions between gut bacteria and brain chemistry, highlighting the importance of dietary choices in maintaining mental health. By prioritizing nutritious foods, we can support both our physical and mental well-being, paving the way for a healthier, happier life. Understanding and harnessing the power of the gut-brain connection offers a promising avenue for improving mental health through dietary interventions.
