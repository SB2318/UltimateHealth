# Blood Cancer (Leukemia)

## What is Blood Cancer?
Blood cancer, commonly known as leukemia, is a type of cancer that begins in the bone marrow, where blood cells are produced. The disease causes the production of abnormal white blood cells, which do not function properly. These abnormal cells multiply rapidly and can crowd out healthy cells, leading to severe complications such as anemia, infection, and bleeding.

## Signs of Blood Cancer
The signs and symptoms of leukemia can vary depending on the type of leukemia, but common signs include:

- **Fatigue and Weakness**: Persistent tiredness that doesn't improve with rest.
- **Frequent Infections**: Recurrent infections due to a weakened immune system.
- **Bruising and Bleeding**: Easy bruising, frequent nosebleeds, or bleeding gums.
- **Bone or Joint Pain**: Pain in the bones or joints due to the abnormal cells accumulating in these areas.
- **Swollen Lymph Nodes**: Enlarged lymph nodes, especially in the neck, armpits, or groin.
- **Fever and Night Sweats**: Persistent fevers or excessive sweating at night.

## Causes of Leukemia
The exact cause of leukemia is not entirely known, but certain factors have been identified that increase the risk of developing this disease:

- **Genetic Factors**: Inherited genetic mutations and conditions such as Down syndrome can increase the likelihood of developing leukemia.
- **Exposure to Radiation or Chemicals**: High levels of radiation exposure or exposure to certain chemicals like benzene can elevate the risk.
- **Smoking**: Smoking is a significant risk factor for acute myeloid leukemia (AML).
- **Previous Cancer Treatment**: Chemotherapy or radiation therapy for other cancers can increase the risk of developing leukemia later in life.
- **Family History**: A family history of leukemia may suggest a genetic predisposition to the disease.

## Types of Blood Cancer
There are several types of leukemia, which can be broadly categorized into:

- **Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL)**: Rapidly progressing, most common in children.
- **Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML)**: Rapidly progressing, more common in adults.
- **Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL)**: Slowly progressing, often detected in older adults.
- **Chronic Myeloid Leukemia (CML)**: Slowly progressing, linked to a specific genetic mutation.

## Treatment of Leukemia
The treatment of leukemia depends on several factors, including the type of leukemia, the patient’s age, overall health, and the stage of the disease. Common treatment options include:

- **Chemotherapy**: The most common treatment, using drugs to kill leukemia cells.
- **Radiation Therapy**: High-energy radiation to kill or damage leukemia cells.
- **Stem Cell Transplant**: Replacing diseased bone marrow with healthy marrow from a donor.
- **Targeted Therapy**: Drugs that specifically target certain parts of leukemia cells.

## Is It Possible That Blood Cancer Exists During Birth or in Infants?
Yes, leukemia can indeed exist at birth or develop in infants, although it is a rare occurrence. This form of leukemia, often referred to as **congenital leukemia** or **infant leukemia**, is usually diagnosed within the first month of life or even during the prenatal stage.

### Causes and Risk Factors
The exact causes of infant leukemia are not well understood, but several factors may contribute to its development:

- **Genetic Mutations**: Some cases of infant leukemia are linked to genetic mutations that occur during fetal development. These mutations can affect blood cell production, leading to the uncontrolled growth of abnormal cells.
  
- **In-Utero Exposures**: Although not conclusive, some research suggests that exposure to certain environmental factors during pregnancy, such as radiation or certain chemicals, might increase the risk of developing leukemia in the fetus.

- **Chromosomal Abnormalities**: Conditions such as Down syndrome and other genetic disorders are associated with a higher risk of leukemia in infants. These conditions often involve chromosomal abnormalities that can predispose an infant to leukemia.

### Symptoms and Diagnosis
Infant leukemia may present with a range of symptoms that can be similar to those seen in older children and adults with leukemia. These symptoms include:

- **Pallor**: A pale appearance due to anemia.
- **Petechiae and Bruising**: Small red or purple spots on the skin and easy bruising, indicating low platelet counts.
- **Enlarged Organs**: The liver and spleen may become enlarged due to the accumulation of leukemia cells.
- **Fever and Irritability**: Persistent fever and irritability without a clear cause.

Diagnosis typically involves blood tests to identify abnormal white blood cells, bone marrow biopsy to confirm the presence of leukemia cells, and genetic testing to identify specific mutations or chromosomal abnormalities.

### Treatment and Prognosis
The treatment of infant leukemia is complex and often involves aggressive chemotherapy, and in some cases, a stem cell transplant may be considered. The prognosis for infants with leukemia can vary widely depending on factors such as the type of leukemia, the presence of specific genetic mutations, and the infant's response to treatment.

While congenital leukemia is rare, ongoing research is essential to better understand its causes and to develop more effective treatments. Early detection and specialized care are critical to improving outcomes for infants diagnosed with this challenging condition.

## Survival Rate
The survival rate for leukemia varies depending on the type of leukemia, the patient’s age, how early the disease is detected, and how it responds to treatment. Survival rates provide an estimate of how many people live for a certain period after being diagnosed:

- **Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL)**: About 85% of children with ALL survive five years or more after diagnosis.
- **Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML)**: Approximately 25% of adults with AML survive five years or more.
- **Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL)**: The five-year survival rate is around 85%.
- **Chronic Myeloid Leukemia (CML)**: The five-year survival rate is about 70%.

## Side Effects
Leukemia and its treatment can cause various side effects, which can differ depending on the type and stage of leukemia, as well as the specific treatment being used. Common side effects include:

- **Fatigue**: Extreme tiredness or weakness.
- **Nausea and Vomiting**: Caused by chemotherapy.
- **Hair Loss**: Due to chemotherapy drugs targeting rapidly dividing cells.
- **Bruising and Bleeding**: Frequent bruising, nosebleeds, or other forms of bleeding.
- **Infections**: A weakened immune system makes patients more susceptible to infections.

## Detailed Example of Survival and Treatment: Meeting a Perfect Match
Three years after a stem cell transplant, a leukemia survivor met her perfect match.

**BY Ticia Hanisch**

I was 71 years old when Guillermo Garcia-Manero, M.D., diagnosed me with aggressive, high-risk acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) that had developed from my myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) in October 2018. Despite feeling great, my bloodwork during an annual physical told a different story.

I qualified for a Phase I clinical trial and standard care treatment. After my first treatment in November, my blasts (immature cells) were reduced from 28% to 6%. By March, my blasts had stabilized at 2%, but my blood counts never recovered. In June, Dr. GGM, as I call him, noted that my AML had reverted to DS (myelodysplastic syndrome). He explained to my husband and me that my only option for survival was a stem cell transplant.

A transplant is a serious procedure, and I had many questions: With no chemotherapy in July, would my blasts stay under 5%? At 72, was my age a factor? Would I pass the rigorous tests? Would insurance cover the procedure? And, most hauntingly, would I have a donor match?

These concerns brought back memories of 1992 when my brother, diagnosed with AML, shared that finding a match would be like winning the lottery. He found no match and died before his twin sons turned 2.

Fortunately, I passed all the tests. My age was not an obstacle, insurance covered the procedure, and best of all, I had three potential matches. My transplant was scheduled for Aug. 14, 2019.

My first match was unavailable, and my second match, Dominik, who lived in Germany, could have declined due to family reasons. However, he unselfishly committed to donating his stem cells to a complete stranger thousands of miles away in another country.

On Aug. 8, 2019, I was admitted to the 17th floor at MD Anderson, and on Aug. 14, surrounded by my immediate family, I underwent a stem cell transplant under the care of Richard Champlin, M.D. I am deeply grateful for my medical team, my family, my husband, my faith, my prayer warriors, and to Dominik, my hero, who selflessly donated his stem cells, giving me a second chance at life.

After staying close to MD Anderson for 100 days post-transplant, I returned home just before Thanksgiving 2019. The holiday was extra special that year, filled with gratitude and family.

Two months later, my leukemia mutation reappeared, but Dominik’s cells did exactly what they were supposed to: they recognized the mutation as foreign and eradicated it. During my next bone marrow biopsy, the mutation was gone, and all my blood cells were now Dominik’s. You could hear me cheering with joy.

Despite facing graft vs. host disease three months later, which was resolved after nine months with steroid treatment, I continue to remain in remission. As I reflect on my journey, I am profoundly grateful for Dominik’s selfless act and my unwavering support system. Without them, I would not be here today, celebrating the love of life.

On May 1, 2023, exactly 1,358 days after my transplant, I had the opportunity to meet Dominik and his family face-to-face. We exchanged emails before meeting in person, and I could not hold back tears when I saw him for the first time. Meeting him and his family was an emotional and profound experience, one that I will cherish for the rest of my life.

I consider Dominik my “little brother” and a miracle. He may not be biologically related to me, but he is a hero in my eyes. Thanks to him, I have been given a second chance to enjoy life and watch my grandchildren grow up. His selflessness and courage will forever hold a special place in my heart, and I am eternally grateful for the gift of life he has given me.

Dominik, you are my perfect match, my hero, and my brother. Thank you for giving me a second chance at life.
