## Testing Frontend with Localhost Backend Server

When working with a backend server running on localhost, frontend developers can follow these guidelines to test their application:

1. **Start the backend server**
   - Before testing the frontend application, ensure that the backend server is running on localhost.
   - Navigate to the backend project directory and start the server (e.g., `node server.js` for a Node.js server).
   - The server should be listening on a specific port (e.g., `http://localhost:{PORT}`).

2. **Configure the frontend application**
   - In the frontend application, locate the configuration file or the section where the API base URL is defined.
   - Set the API base URL to point to the local backend server.

3. **Use appropriate HTTP clients**
   - During development, frontend developers can use browser tools like the Network tab in the developer tools or dedicated HTTP clients like Postman or Insomnia to test the backend API endpoints.
   - Send HTTP requests to the local backend server and observe the responses.

4. **Handle CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing)**
   - If the frontend application is running on a different port or domain than the backend server, the browser may block the requests due to CORS restrictions.
   - To handle CORS, the backend server should be configured to allow cross-origin requests from the frontend application's origin.
   - CORS is handled in the current backend server

5. **Proxy requests (optional)**
   - Some frontend frameworks (e.g., Create React App, Vue CLI) provide a built-in proxy feature that forwards requests from the frontend application to the backend server.
   - Configure the proxy in the frontend application's development settings to automatically forward API requests to the local backend server.

6. **Use environment variables**
   - Avoid hardcoding the backend server URL in the frontend application.
   - Instead, use environment variables to store the backend server URL and read it during runtime.

7. **Test different scenarios**
   - Test various user flows and interactions with the backend API, such as creating, reading, updating, and deleting data.
   - Simulate different scenarios, including error cases and edge cases, to ensure the frontend application and backend server handle them correctly.

**Access the application:**
Open your web browser and navigate to (LOCAL_HOST_URL).
