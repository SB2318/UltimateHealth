## Abstract 

This article covers stroke as a medical emergency that happens when there is an interruption or reduction in blood flow to a portion of the brain, depriving the brain tissue of oxygen and nutrients that it needs. The two main kinds of strokes are hemorrhagic, which is brought on by blood vessels rupturing or spilling, and ischemic, which is brought on by blockages or constriction of brain blood arteries. If treatment for a stroke is delayed, it may result in death or significant brain damage. Age, health issues like diabetes and hypertension, heredity, and lifestyle decisions are risk factors. Stroke symptoms might include excruciating migraines, paralysis, and trouble speaking. It's imperative to get medical help right away. Modifying one's lifestyle and taking care of health issues are examples of prevention tactics. Let's get deep dive into the respective causes, symptoms and preventive methods.

## What is Stroke ?

When a portion of the brain's blood supply is cut off or obstructed, an ischemic stroke happens. This keeps oxygen and nutrients from reaching the brain tissue. Within minutes, brain cells start to die. Hemorrhagic strokes are another kind of stroke. Bleeding in the brain happens when a blood vessel leaks or bursts in the brain. The blood destroys brain cells by putting them under increased strain.

An emergency in medicine is a stroke. The urgent need for medical attention cannot be overstated. Rapid access to emergency medical care can lessen brain damage and other consequences of stroke.

The good news is that stroke deaths have decreased over time. Effective therapies can also aid in preventing stroke-related impairment.

### Who does it affects ?

All ages, including children, are susceptible to stroke, while certain individuals are more vulnerable than others. Strokes are more common in later life (those over 65 account for around two thirds of all stroke cases).

A person's risk of stroke can also be increased by a number of medical disorders, such as hypertension, hyperlipidemia, Type 2 diabetes, and a history of heart attacks, strokes, or abnormal heart rhythms such as atrial fibrillation.

### How common is Stroke ?

Strokes occur frequently. Strokes are the second leading cause of death globally. Stroke ranks as the sixth leading cause of mortality in the US. Another major global source of impairment is strokes.

### How does it affects my body ?

What a heart attack is to your heart, a stroke is to your brain. A stroke results in the loss of blood flow to a portion of the brain, depriving it of oxygen. The impacted brain cells become oxygen-starved and malfunction when there is insufficient oxygen.

The oxygen-starved brain cells will eventually perish. An part of the brain can get permanently damaged and you may lose the ability to control it if enough brain cells in that area die. Restoring blood flow, however, might stop that kind of injury or at least lessen its severity. Time is therefore of the essence while treating a stroke.

## Symptoms

If you think that you or someone you know might be experiencing a stroke, note when the symptoms started. Certain medications work best when administered shortly after the onset of a stroke.

A stroke's symptoms include:

- Difficulty comprehending and conversing with people. 
- A stroke victim may exhibit confusion, slur words, or lose their ability to comprehend spoken words.
- Face, arm, or leg numbness, weakness, or paralysis. Usually, this just affects one side of the body. 
**Example** One may attempt to lift both arms over the head. A stroke may be indicated if one arm starts to droop. When attempting to grin, one side of the lips may also droop.
- Issues with one or both eyes' vision. 
- A sudden, severe headache may be a symptom of a stroke. Vomiting, dizziness and a change in consciousness may occur with the headache.
- Someone having a stroke may stumble or lose balance or coordination.

## When to visit a Doctor

If you have any stroke symptoms, get medical help right away, even if they seem to come and go or go away entirely. Think "FAST" and take the subsequent actions:


- Face: Request a grin from the person. Does the face sag on one side?
- Arms: Request that they lift both of their arms. Does one arm sag to the side? Or can only one arm raise?
- Conversation: Request that the individual repeat a short word. Does the individual's speech seem slurred or unusual?
- Momentum: Give 911 or emergency medical assistance a call as soon as you notice any of these symptoms.

## Causes

Stroke has two primary causes. A blocked artery in the brain is the cause of an ischemic stroke. A brain blood artery that bursts or leaks might result in a hemorrhagic stroke. A transient ischemic attack (TIA), which is a brief interruption of blood flow to the brain, may occur in certain individuals. There are no long-lasting symptoms from a TIA.

### 1. Ischemic stroke

The most prevalent kind of stroke is this one. It occurs when there is a blockage or narrowing of the blood arteries in the brain. Ischemia, or decreased blood flow, results from this. Fatty deposits that accumulate in blood arteries might result in blocked or constricted blood vessels. Alternatively, they may be brought on by blood clots or other material that passes through the circulation, usually from the heart. When fat deposits, blood clots, or other debris get stuck in the blood arteries in the brain, it can cause an ischemic stroke.

Further research is necessary, however preliminary findings suggest that COVID-19 infection may raise the risk of ischemic stroke.

### 2. Hemorrhagic stroke

Hemorrhagic stroke occurs when a blood vessel in the brain leaks or ruptures. Brain hemorrhages, or internal bleeding in the brain, can be caused by a variety of blood vessel-related illnesses. Hemorrhagic stroke risk factors include:

- Uncontrolled high blood pressure.
- Abuse of blood thinners, sometimes referred to as anticoagulants.
- Aneurysms are bulges at weak points in the blood vessel walls.
- Head trauma, like that sustained in a collision.
- Protein buildup in blood vessel walls causes the wall to become weaker. This is referred to as amyloid angiopathy of the brain.
- Cerebral bleeding caused by an ischemic stroke.
- Rupture of an arteriovenous malformation is a less common cause of bleeding in the brain (AVM). An AVM is a haphazard network of blood arteries with weak walls.

## Transient Ischemic Attack

Similar to a stroke, a transient ischemic attack (TIA) has fleeting consequences. It is frequently referred to as a "mini-stroke." These are frequently indicators that someone is quite likely to experience a real stroke in the near future. A TIA sufferer thus requires immediate medical attention as soon as possible.

## Risk Factors 

The risk of stroke can be raised by numerous circumstances. Among the stroke risk factors that may be treated are:

### Risk factors related to lifestyle

- Being too heavy or fat.
- Absence of physical exercise.
- Excessive or binge drinking.
- Usage of illicit substances like methamphetamine and cocaine.


### Risk factors for medicine

- Elevated blood pressure.
- Smoking cigarettes or being around smoke.
- Elevated cholesterol.
- Diabetes.
- Apnea obstructive sleep.
- Heart failure, heart defects, heart infections, and irregular heart rhythms like atrial fibrillation are all examples of cardiovascular disease.
- History of stroke, heart attack, or transient ischemic attack in oneself or one's family.
- COVID-19 infection.

### Other factors associated with a higher risk of stroke include:

- Age — People age 55 or older have a higher risk of stroke than do younger people.
- Race or ethnicity — African American and Hispanic people have a higher risk of stroke than do people of other races or ethnicities.
- Sex — Men have a higher risk of stroke than do women. Women are usually older when they have strokes, and they're more likely to die of strokes than are men.
- Hormones — Taking birth control pills or hormone therapies that include estrogen can increase risk.

## Prevention 

It is possible to take action to stop a stroke. It's critical to understand your risk factors for stroke and to heed your healthcare provider's recommendations for healthy living. Following a stroke, following precautions may help you avoid having another one. These actions can help reduce your risk of stroke if you have experienced a transient ischemic attack (TIA). The treatment you receive both during and after your stay in the hospital could also be important.

Heart disease and stroke prevention tactics are similar in many ways. Generally speaking, suggestions for a healthy lifestyle consist of:

- Control high blood pressure, known as hypertension
- Lower the amount of cholesterol and saturated fat in your diet
- Quit tobacco use
- Manage diabetes
- Maintain a healthy weight
- Eat a diet rich in fruits and vegetables
- Exercise regularly
- Drink alcohol in moderation, if at all
- Treat obstructive sleep apnea (OSA)
- Don't use illicit drugs

## Medications 

Depending on the type of stroke and the patient's timing of therapy, different drugs and therapies are employed. Long-term stroke treatments are also available. These occur in the days and months following emergency care for the immediate risk of stroke.

In general, the best person to advise you on the course of treatment or courses of action is your healthcare professional. They can customize the data they offer to your particular situation, taking into account things like your personal circumstances, medical history, and more.

| Ischemic stroke   | Hemorrhagic stroke |
|------------------|----------------------|
| Thrombolytic drugs (within three to four and a half hours) | Blood pressure management |
| Thrombectomy (within 24 hours if there’s no significant brain damage) | Reversal of any medication that might increase bleeding |
| Blood pressure management | Use of medications or surgery to reduce pressure inside your skull |

### Thrombolytic Drugs

Within the first three hours following the onset of stroke symptoms, thrombolytic medications (whose name is derived from the Greek words "thrombus," which means "clot," and "lysis," which means "loosening/dissolving") may be a possibility. These drugs break apart blood clots that already exist. However, they are only a viable option within that three to four and a half hour window, as they raise the possibility of hazardous bleeding issues beyond that point.

### Mechanical Thrombectomy

Mechanical thrombectomy is a catheterization method that can be used in certain situations, particularly when thrombolytic medicines are not an option. Procedures for thrombectomy are also time-sensitive; the ideal window for these operations is 24 hours following the onset of symptoms. A catheter, or tube-like device, is inserted into a large blood vessel and guided up to the brain clot during this surgery. Once there, a device that can remove the clot is attached to the tip of the catheter.

###  Blood Pressure Management

Lowering blood pressure is an essential component of treating hemorrhagic strokes because it is typically the cause of these events. Blood vessel injury can be sealed more easily by clotting when blood pressure is reduced.

### Clotting Assistance

Hemostasis is a process that your body uses to stop bleeding and heal wounds so that your clotting capacity can function. In order to support hemostasis, drugs or blood components that facilitate coagulation are infused. Infusions of prothrombin or clotting factor, vitamin K therapy, and other treatments are examples. This treatment can help stop bleeding and is most commonly used for hemorrhagic strokes (particularly in patients on blood thinners).

### Surgery 

In some cases, surgery is necessary to relieve the pressure on your brain. This is especially true with subarachnoid hemorrhages, which are easier to reach because they’re on the outer surface of your brain.

## Effective Therapy

Assisting an individual in recuperating or adjusting to the alterations in their brain is a crucial aspect of stroke treatment. This is particularly true in terms of aiding in their recovery of pre-stroke abilities. For most stroke victims, a significant component of their recovery is stroke rehabilitation. There are numerous ways that rehabilitation can occur, such as:

- Speech therapy can help you restore your capacity to speak and understand language as well as enhance your control over the muscles that are necessary for breathing, eating, drinking, and swallowing.

- Physical therapy: It can assist you in regaining or improving your hand, arm, foot, and leg function. In addition, this can aid with muscular weakness, balance problems, and more.

- Occupational therapy: This might assist in retraining your brain to enable you to carry out your everyday activities. This treatment is particularly beneficial for enhancing dexterity and muscular control.

- Cognitive therapy: If you experience memory issues, this may be beneficial. It can also be helpful if you struggle to focus or concentrate on tasks that you used to be able to complete.

There are many other possible therapies. 

## Recovery 

Recovery from a stroke is a multifaceted process that involves both medical treatment and rehabilitation to help the individual regain as much function as possible. A patient's road to recovery frequently begins in the hospital, where prompt medical attention stabilizes them and reduces brain damage. Following stabilization of the patient, the emphasis shifts to rehabilitation, with therapies customized to meet the unique requirements of the stroke survivor. Physical therapy for increased strength and mobility, occupational therapy for relearning everyday tasks, speech therapy for communication problems, and cognitive therapy for memory and cognitive difficulties are a few examples of this. It can take a while to recuperate, so it's important to have patience, perseverance, and support from loved ones, friends, and medical experts. While some stroke survivors may suffer from long-term or permanent disability, many can make great improvements and lead full lives with the correct care and rehabilitation plan.

## Conclusion

Stroke continues to be a major global source of death and disability, affecting people of all ages. Immediate symptom recognition and timely medical care are essential for reducing brain damage and enhancing results. Advances in medical treatments and preventive measures have led to a decline in the death rate of stroke, notwithstanding its prevalence. In order to lower the incidence and consequences of stroke, it is imperative that risk factors be managed, early detection identified, and public awareness be sustained. Many stroke victims are able to restore functioning and lead full lives with the help of efficient therapies and rehabilitation.
