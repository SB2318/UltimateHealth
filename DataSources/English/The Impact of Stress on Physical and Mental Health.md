#### How does it affect us?

Stress affects both the mind and the body. A little bit of stress is good and can help us perform daily activities. Too much stress can cause physical and mental health problems. Learning how to cope with stress can help us feel less overwhelmed and support our mental and physical well-being.

#### What are signs of stress?

Stress makes it hard for us to relax and can come with a range of emotions, including anxiety and irritability. When stressed, we may find it difficult to concentrate. We may experience headaches or other body pains, an upset stomach or trouble sleeping. We may find we lose our appetite or eat more than usual. Chronic stress can worsen pre-existing health problems and may increase our use of alcohol, tobacco and other substances.

Stressful situations can also cause or exacerbate mental health conditions, most commonly anxiety and depression, which require access to health care. When we suffer from a mental health condition, it may be because our symptoms of stress have become persistent and have started affecting our daily functioning, including at work or school.

#### Stress vs. Anxiety: What's the Difference?

Stress can sometimes be mistaken for anxiety, and experiencing a great deal of stress can contribute to feelings of anxiety. Stress and anxiety both contribute to nervousness, poor sleep, high blood pressure, muscle tension, and excess worry. Experiencing anxiety can make it more difficult to cope with stress and may contribute to other health issues, including increased depression, susceptibility to illness, and digestive problems.

### Exercise

To begin, regular physical exercise can help you sleep better. And improved sleep leads to better stress management. Doctors aren't sure why, but those who exercise more get better deep "slow wave" sleep, which helps regenerate the brain and body. Just be careful not to exercise too close to bedtime, as this might interrupt sleep for some individuals. Exercise also helps to improve mood. Part of the explanation might be because marijuana causes your body to generate a variety of chemicals, including endorphins and endocannabinoids, which help block pain, promote sleep, and relax you. Some of these (endocannabinoids) may be responsible for the euphoric sensation, or "runner's high," that some individuals experience after lengthy runs.

People who exercise also tend to feel less anxious and more positive about themselves. When your body feels good, your mind often follows. Get a dose of stress relief with these exercises:

- Running
- Swimming
- Dancing
- Cycling
- Aerobics

If you don't have the time for a formal exercise program, you can still find ways to move throughout your day. Try these tips:

- Bike instead of driving to the store.
- Use the stairs instead of the elevator.
- Park as far as you can from the door.
- Hand-wash your car.
- Clean your house.
- Walk on your lunch break.

### Diet

Eating good foods has several advantages, including improved mental wellness. A balanced diet can reduce the impacts of stress, strengthen your immune system, improve your mood, and lower your blood pressure. High levels of added sugar and fat might have the opposite impact. When you're under a lot of stress, junk food might appear especially attractive. To keep healthy and balanced, consume complex carbs, lean proteins, and fatty acids like fish, meat, eggs, and nuts. Antioxidants are also helpful. They safeguard your cells from the harm that continuous stress can inflict. They may be found in a wide range of foods including beans, fruits, berries, vegetables, and spices like ginger. Maintain a healthy diet with a few easy guidelines. Create a shopping list. Take healthful food with you when you leave the house. Avoid processed meals and try to eat mindfully.

Scientists have identified several nutrients that appear to help reduce the impact of stress on the body and mind. Make sure you obtain plenty of them as part of a balanced diet.

- Vitamin C 
- Magnesium
- Omega-3 Fatty Acids

### Sleep

A common side effect of stress is that you may struggle to fall asleep. If this happens three times a week for at least 3 months, you may have insomnia, an inability to fall and stay asleep. Lack of sleep can also add to your stress level and cause a cycle of stress and sleeplessness. Better sleep habits can help. This includes both your daily routine and the way you set up your bedroom. Habits that may help include:

- Exercise regularly.
- Get out in the sunlight.
- Drink less alcohol and caffeine close to bedtime.
- Set a sleep schedule.
- Don’t look at your electronics 30-60 minutes before bed.
- Try meditation or other forms of relaxation at bedtime.

### Relaxation Techniques

- **Yoga** : This is a sort of exercise that may also be used for meditation. There are several styles of yoga. Slow movement, stretching, and deep breathing exercises are the most effective for reducing anxiety and tension.

- **Meditation** : It has existed for more than 5,000 years for a purpose. Meditation works successfully for many people and provides several advantages. It can reduce tension, anxiety, and chronic pain while also improving sleep, energy levels, and mood.

- **Deep breathing** : When you practice deep breathing, you turn on your body’s natural ability to relax. This creates a state of deep rest that can change how your body responds to stress. It sends more oxygen to your brain and calms the part of your nervous system that handles your ability to relax.

- **Try belly breathing** : Get comfortable, close your eyes, and place one hand on your stomach and the other on your chest. Take a deep breath in through your nose. You should feel your belly rise more than your chest. Now, exhale through your nose and pay close attention to how your body relaxes. Repeat.

- **Biofeedback** : Learn how to manage your heart rate, muscle tension, and blood pressure when stress hits. Biofeedback gives you information about how your body reacts when you try to relax. Sensors are placed on your body that call out changes in everything from your brain-wave pattern to your muscle tone. Working with a biofeedback therapist, you can start to take control of the signals by changing how your body reacts to the sensor

- **Connect with people** : Spend time with a friend or family member who will listen to you. It is a natural way to calm you and lower your stress. When you connect with people in person, your body releases a hormone that stops your fight-or-flight response. You relax.

- **Inner voice** : Nothing affects your stress levels like the voice inside your head. The good news is you are in control. You can exchange negative thoughts for positive ones. There are more benefits to positive self-talk than reducing stress. These include a longer life, lower levels of depression, greater resistance to the common cold and cardiovascular disease, and better coping skills for when hard times hit.

- **Laugh therapy** : When you laugh, you take in more oxygen. Your heart, lungs, and muscles get a boost and your body releases those feel-good hormones. Laughter also improves your immune system, lessens pain, and improves your mood for long periods of time.

- **Talk therapy** : Long-term talk therapy helps some people deal with stress. One approach, cognitive behavioral therapy, helps you change negative thought patterns. Your therapist can guide you toward other approaches that might be helpful.

## Seeking Professional Help

It can be challenging to determine whether you are experiencing a natural response to a stressful event or dealing with a more serious mental health issue. Only a professional such as a psychologist, psychiatrist or licensed professional counselor can accurately evaluate your mental well-being and suggest a plan for treatment if necessary.

However, there are some signs to look out for when assessing your own mental health and deciding if professional help is necessary:

- A prolonged feeling of sadness
- Loss of interest in social activities
- Changes in sleeping or eating patterns
- Increased drug or alcohol use
- Auditory or visual hallucinations
- Extreme emotional highs and lows
- Thoughts of self-harm or suicide
- Paranoia
- Fatigue or lack of energy not related to physical health conditions
- Weight gain or loss unattributed to another condition

If you experience one or more of these symptoms, take action. “The time to seek help would be when your daily functioning is impacted in a negative way,” says Kaur. “For example, this could be leaving your home, going to work, driving or any part of your daily routine. The difference between sadness and depression is loss of hope or safety. If the sadness is taking over your life for more than a month following an upsetting event, you should seek professional help.”
