# About
Vitamin D deficiency occurs when the level of vitamin D in your body is too low. Vitamin D is essential for maintaining healthy bones and teeth, supporting immune, brain, and nervous system health, regulating insulin levels, and supporting lung function and cardiovascular health. It can result from inadequate dietary intake, limited sunlight exposure, disorders limiting vitamin D absorption, and conditions impairing the conversion of vitamin D into its active metabolites.


## Psychosis 

A mental health condition characterized by a disconnection from reality. Individuals experiencing psychosis may have hallucinations (seeing or hearing things that aren't there) or delusions (strongly held false beliefs).

## Schizophrenia 
A chronic and severe mental disorder that affects how a person thinks, feels, and behaves. Schizophrenia is marked by episodes of psychosis, along with other symptoms such as disorganized thinking, impaired functioning, and cognitive deficits.

## Symptoms
- Hallucinations: Sensory experiences without external stimuli. Common forms include auditory hallucinations (hearing voices) and visual hallucinations.
- Delusions: Strongly held beliefs that are not based in reality. Common delusions include paranoid delusions (believing others are out to harm you) and grandiose delusions (believing you have extraordinary powers or importance).
- Disorganized Thinking: Difficulty organizing thoughts, leading to incoherent or nonsensical speech.
- Impaired Insight: Lack of awareness that one's experiences are not based in reality.

## Causes and Risk Factors
- Genetic Factors:
Schizophrenia has a strong genetic component, with individuals having a first-degree relative with the disorder being at higher risk.
However, genetics alone do not determine the development of schizophrenia or psychosis.
- Neurobiological Factors:
Abnormalities in brain structure and function, particularly in the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus, are associated with schizophrenia.
Neurotransmitter imbalances, particularly involving dopamine and glutamate, are believed to play a significant role in psychosis.
- Environmental Factors:
Prenatal exposure to infections or malnutrition, psychosocial stressors, and drug abuse (especially cannabis) have been linked to an increased risk of developing schizophrenia and psychosis.
Early life trauma, including abuse or neglect, can also contribute to the onset of psychosis.
