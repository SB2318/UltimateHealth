## Abstract

This article highlights the causes, symptoms, vaccinations and India’s response to epidemics since 1900s. It explores major outbreaks like the Spanish Flu, pandemics of cholera, and more recent ones like SARS and COVID-19.Consequently, it engages attention concerning India’s health-care conditions, societal ramifications and formation of health tactics.  The essay offers insights into how India has dealt with major health crises over the years through an examination of historical and contemporary outbreaks.

## What is an Epidemic?

When a certain disease appears in a population, region, or community at a rate that is noticeably higher than normal, it is called an epidemic. Epidemiological studies are concerned with the periodic occurrence of a special disease in a population, region, or community at a rate that is recognizably above the norm. 

The World Health Organization (WHO) defines an epidemic as the occurrence of disease cases, certain health-related behaviors, or other health-related events that are manifestly above normal expectations in a community or region. The cases are specifically defined as well as the community or region and time frame in which they occur. Depending on the agent, the size and nature of the exposed population, prior exposure or lack thereof, and other factors, the number of instances indicating the presence of an epidemic varies.

The causes regarding epidermic can be bacteria, viruses and parasites. They may also be the aftermath of non-communicable factors such changes in the environment or an abrupt rise in a specific toxin's concentration. Among the crucial elements of an epidemic are:

1. **Rapid Spread**: Epidemics on the other hand are characterized by a rapid unstoppable transmission of disease, within a short time affecting a large population.
2. **Geographic Concentration**: The spread is generally restrained to one area or a certain community, although it may expand if not controlled.
3. **Higher-than-Expected Cases**: The number of cases significantly exceeds what is typically observed in that population.

Epidemics have occurred throughout history, with notable examples including the Black Death in the 14th century, the Spanish Flu in 1918, and more recently, the COVID-19 pandemic, which although initially an epidemic, quickly escalated to a pandemic due to its global spread.

## Major Epidemics in India Since the 1900s

India has been a country with a high population density, diverse climates, and varying socio-economic conditions, making it vulnerable to numerous epidemics throughout its history. The large population and frequent movement of people within and outside the country have often facilitated the rapid spread of infectious diseases. This article provides an overview of some of the most devastating epidemics that have affected India since the 1900s.

### Encephalitis Lethargica (1915-1926)

Encephalitis lethargica, also known as lethargic encephalitis, was an acute contagious disease where the virus attacked the central nervous system. It was characterized by increasing languor, apathy, drowsiness, and lethargy. While the epidemic was widespread in Europe, it appeared sporadically in India, causing significant concern and highlighting the need for better disease monitoring and response mechanisms.

### Spanish Flu (1918-1920)

The Spanish Flu was caused by a deadly strain of avian influenza and spread globally due to World War I. In India, returning soldiers became carriers of the disease, which resulted in an estimated 10 to 20 million deaths, making India the country with the highest mortality rate. This epidemic severely impacted the healthcare system and the socio-economic structure of the nation.

### Cholera Pandemic (1961-1975)

From 1961 to 1975, India was affected by the seventh cholera pandemic, caused by the Vibrio cholerae bacteria. Inadequate cleaner water facility, sewerage facilities in Kolkata lead to the city being the disease hot spot in India for cholera. The pandemic underscored the importance of clean water and sanitation facilities in preventing the spread of infectious diseases.

### Flu Pandemic (1968-1969)

The immediate outbreak of the current flu or flu strain caused by H3N2 strain of the influenza A virus. Came from Hong Kong and engulfed India within two months in the year 1968. The rate at which the virus transmitted pointed out flaws in the global and local public health systems in term monitoring and containing spread of infectious diseases.

### Smallpox Epidemic (1974)

Smallpox is a contagious disease provoked by Variola major or Variola minor virus , India experienced an outbreak in 1974. Smallpox infected area was concentrated in India and at this time it was reported that 60% of the global incidence of smallpox originated in India.  Despite the National Smallpox Eradication Program, the epidemic persisted until international assistance helped India achieve eradication in 1977.

### Plague in Surat (1994)

In September 1994, a pneumonic plague outbreak occurred in Surat, causing mass panic and an exodus from the city. The outbreak was exacerbated by poor urban sanitation conditions, including open drains and inadequate sewage systems. Engaging in the activities to disinsect the city within the shortest time possible eased the management of the calamity by the local government.

### SARS (2002-2004)

Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), caused by the SARS-CoV virus, emerged as a significant health threat in the early 2000s. Although it did not turn into a large scale uprise in India the capacity to spread at a high velocity and the comparatively high mortality rate kept the monitoring tight and readiness measures intact.

### Dengue and Chikungunya Outbreak (2006)

In 2006, India faced outbreaks of both dengue and chikungunya, mosquito-borne diseases. Stagnant water in various parts of the country provided breeding grounds for mosquitoes, leading to widespread transmission. The outbreaks affected many regions, with Delhi reporting the highest number of cases.

### Gujarat Hepatitis Outbreak (2009)

The case of Hepatitis B outbreak occured in February 2009 in Gujarat is attributed to the local doctors who used contaminated syringes. This event demonstrated that the medical practitioners had laps on the kind of practices that needs to be regulated and checked to eliminate its use.

### Odisha Jaundice Outbreak (2014-2015)

Odisha witnessed a jaundice outbreak in 2014, primarily caused by contaminated drinking water due to drainage water seeping into pipelines. This outbreak underscored the importance of maintaining clean water supplies and proper sanitation to prevent waterborne diseases.

### Swine Flu Outbreak (2014-2015)

Another dangerous virus that affected India was the H1N1 virus, popularly referred to as the swine flu. The outbreak was noticed from the late 2014 to early 2015.  States like Gujarat, Rajasthan, Delhi, Maharashtra, and Telangana were severely affected. Despite public awareness campaigns, the virus led to at least 33,000 infections and 2,000 fatalities by March 2015.

### COVID-19 Pandemic (2020-2022)

The COVID-19 was first categorised as an epidemic, which later morphed into a global pandemic.In India, it resulted in severe healthcare challenges, economic disruptions, and a significant loss of life. The pandemic underscored the importance of preparedness, robust healthcare systems, and effective public health strategies. It also fashioned up the creation and distribution of vaccines that play a critical role in addressing the situation.

---

Given the scale and impact of these epidemics, it has often been difficult for India to recover quickly. Each epidemic has tested the resilience of the healthcare system and the population, highlighting the need for continuous improvement in public health infrastructure, disease surveillance, and emergency response.

# Encephalitis Lethargica (1915-1926)

### Origin and Symptoms

Encephalitis Lethargica, also known as lethargic encephalitis, was a mysterious disease that spread globally between 1915 and 1926. Its exact origin remains unknown, but it is thought to have emerged in Europe during or shortly after World War I. The disease affected the central nervous system, leading to symptoms such as extreme tiredness, apathy, drowsiness, and profound lethargy.  More severe cases may actually worsen to coma and in some cases death. The virus spread through nasal and oral secretions.

</p>

### Development of Medicine to Combat It

During the epidemic, researchers worked hard to understand and combat Encephalitis Lethargica. However, due to its sudden disappearance by 1926, the exact cause and effective treatments remained unknown. Due to the restricted knowledge regarding virology and immunology of the top research facilities during that time, research activities were constrained. After each epidemic, there were occasional and unsystematic researches into the causes of the epidemic, vaccines, and curative remedies that failed to produced efficient outcomes.

### Long-Term Health Effects Observed in Subsequent Pandemics

Although Encephalitis Lethargica did not return as a global featuring disease, it raised awareness of potential long-term neurological effects following viral infections. Lessons from studying this disease contributed to advancements in neurology and the understanding of autoimmune diseases affecting the nervous system.

### Precautions

Measures against similar diseases include surveillance to detect the diseases in the early stages, response mechanisms once a suspected disease is detected, and need to observe strict hygiene and sanitation. Further, the development of vaccines for similar related viruses is still necessary to prevent the occurrence of similar outbreaks that has neurological impacts.

# Spanish Flu (1918-1920)

### Origin and Symptoms

Spanish Flu as a result of the H1N1 influenza A virus, infected the whole world between 1918 and 1920 after world War I, the Spanish Flu affected India through soldiers who had contracting the virus from other countries during warfare. The disease symtoms included high fever, chills, severe body aches, and respiratory distress; with extreme cases being pneumonia and death. The rapid spread was facilitated by the movement of troops and civilians during the war.

### Effects on Society

The Spanish Flu pandemic had devastating effects on Indian society. With an estimated death toll ranging from 10 to 20 million, India experienced one of the highest mortality rates worldwide. The impact was particularly severe in densely populated areas and among vulnerable communities with limited access to healthcare. The pandemic strained the already fragile healthcare infrastructure and disrupted economic activities, leading to widespread social unrest and economic hardships.

### Development of Medicine to Combat It

During the Spanish Flu outbreak, health care practices were confined by the knowledge of virology and the absence of antiviral medications or vaccines.  Public health measures such as quarantine, isolation, and basic hygiene practices were implemented to mitigate the spread of the virus. However, due to a very high rate of mutation in the influenza virus, issues with vaccine production proved to limit the measures to control the epidemic.

### Long-Term Health Effects Observed in Subsequent Pandemics

The Spanish Flu pandemic left a lasting impact on global public health strategies. It underscored the importance of international cooperation in disease surveillance, early detection, and rapid response to emerging infectious diseases. Influenza pandemics that occurred after the Spanish Flu; the Asian Flu in 1957 and the Hong Kong Flu in 1968, new vaccines for influenza and measures for coping with the influenza pandemics were developed.

<p align="center">

</p>

The image above illustrates the estimated number of cases and deaths attributed to the Spanish Flu in India during the pandemic period, highlighting the peak mortality rates and the subsequent decline as public health measures were implemented.

### Precautions

Precautions against future influenza pandemics typically involve seasonal influenza vaccination programs, enhanced surveillance of influenza strains circulating in animal populations, and readiness to scale up healthcare and public health response capabilities during outbreaks. Education on measures on hygiene practices include proper washing of the hands and covering the mouth and nose when sneezing and coughing continue to be important in preventing the spread of the influenza viruses.

# Cholera (1961-1975)

### Origin and Symptoms

The Cholera pandemic of 1961-1975 was caused by the Vibrio cholerae bacterium, leading to severe diarrheal disease and dehydration. Vibrio cholerae spreads through contaminated food and water, particularly in areas with poor sanitation. It's Symptoms include sudden onset of diarrhea which is watery, vomiting, and leg cramps leading to severe dehydration and at times shock if untreated.

### Effects on Society

The Cholera pandemic had significant social and economic impacts on India. Kolkata, with its densely populated and unsanitary conditions, became a major epicenter of the outbreak. The disease disproportionately affected vulnerable populations, leading to high mortality rates and widespread fear. The pandemic highlighted the necessity for the enhancement of the Water Management Sanitation facilities and the health protocols that should be put in place to avoid similar threats.

### Development of Medicine and Vaccine

During the Cholera pandemic, efforts focused on improving sanitation practices and developing vaccines. The **Oral Cholera Vaccine (OCV)** was developed as a preventive measure, providing protection against cholera infection by stimulating the immune system to recognize and attack Vibrio cholerae bacteria. Specific vaccination drives were aimed at reaching high risk groups and this has led to a decline in cholera cases over time.

### Long-Term Health Effects and Subsequent Pandemics

The Cholera pandemic led to the changes in public health by enhancing water treatment plants and sanitation. Ongoing research into cholera epidemiology and vaccine development continues to shape global strategies for cholera prevention and control.

### Precautions and Public Health Measures

Precautions against cholera include ensuring access to safe drinking water, practicing good hygiene, and promoting vaccination in endemic areas. Public health authorities emphasize early detection and rapid response to suspected cholera outbreaks to prevent widespread transmission and reduce mortality.

- **Access to Safe Drinking Water:** Ensure access to clean and safe drinking water by improving water treatment and distribution systems.
- **Hygiene Practices:** Promote good hygiene practices such as handwashing with soap and water, especially after using the toilet and before eating or preparing food.
- **Sanitation:** Improve sanitation facilities, including proper disposal of human waste and maintenance of clean and functional toilets.
- **Vaccination:** Encourage vaccination with the Oral Cholera Vaccine (OCV) among high-risk populations, travelers to cholera-endemic areas, and healthcare workers.
- **Surveillance and Early Detection:** Establish robust disease surveillance systems to detect cholera outbreaks early, allowing for prompt public health responses.
- **Community Education:** Educate communities about the causes, symptoms, and prevention of cholera, emphasizing the importance of early treatment and seeking healthcare promptly.

# Flu (1968-1969)

### Origin and Symptoms

The Flu of 1968-1969 also referred to as the Hong Kong Flu was as a result of the H3N2 subtype of the Influenza A virus. The virus spread globally, affecting millions of people. Symptoms included fever, cough, body aches, fatigue, and respiratory issues.Transmission began in Hong Kong and quickly moved to other Asian countries as well as Europe and the Americas.

### Effects on Society

The Flu pandemic had significant social and economic impacts worldwide, including in India.The virus spread swiftly due to increased international travel and trade. There was overburdening of the health systems, as hospitals received a large number of people who needed medical attention.The pandemic exacerbated existing health disparities and posed challenges in managing widespread illness among vulnerable populations.

### Development of Medicine and Vaccine

During the Flu pandemic, efforts focused on developing vaccines to mitigate the spread of the virus. Vaccines for the H3N2 subtype of influenza A were synthesized and disseminated worldwide. However, the rapid mutation rate of influenza viruses and logistical challenges in vaccine production limited their effectiveness in controlling the pandemic.

### Long-Term Health Effects and Subsequent Pandemics

The Flu pandemic of 1968-1969 highlighted the need for improved global coordination in disease surveillance, vaccine development, and public health responses.Some of the findings obtained in the period of pandemic helped to further progress in the sphere of influenza research as well as to develop and improve approaches to combating pandemics in the following decades.

### Table: Overview of Flu Pandemic (1968-1969)

| Country/Region         | Cases (Estimated)      | Deaths (Estimated)    | Key Features                                |

# Smallpox (1974)

### Origin and Symptoms

The Smallpox epidemic in India, particularly severe in 1974, was caused by the Variola virus. Smallpox is characterized by high fever, body rash, and fluid-filled blisters that develop into pustules. The disease spreads through respiratory droplets or direct contact with infected fluids or materials. Smallpox was highly contagious and had a significant mortality rate before its eradication.

### Effects on Society

The Smallpox epidemic had devastating effects on Indian society, with a large number of cases reported across the country. The disease led to high mortality rates and left many survivors with permanent scars or disabilities. The epidemic prompted a concerted global effort, including the World Health Organization's (WHO) vaccination campaigns, which eventually led to the global eradication of smallpox in 1980.

- **Public Education:** Educate communities about the importance of vaccination, early detection of symptoms, and hygiene practices.

## Plague (1994)

### Origin and Symptoms

The Plague outbreak in Surat, India, in 1994 was caused by the bacterium Yersinia pestis, which is transmitted through bites from infected fleas or through direct contact with infected bodily fluids. Some of the signs of pneumonic plague which is the variant that occurred in Surat involve, fever, cough, chest pain, shortness of breath. If untreated, pneumonic plague can be fatal within days.

### Effects on Society

The outbreak triggered widespread panic and mass exodus from Surat as people fled to avoid infection.The city's economy suffered a severe downturn due to the disruption of trade and tourism.Health and welfare facilities reached their capacities, as social rejection of all those areas and people associated with the infected continued even after the spread of the virus was controlled.

### Long-Term Health Effects and Subsequent Pandemics

Following the 1994 outbreak, India improved its disease surveillance systems and public health infrastructure to better respond to future outbreaks. The situation turned out to prove valuable in furthering the principles of quick action, clear communication, and global cooperation in the face of epidemic sicknesses.

### Precautions and Public Health Measures

To prevent and control plague outbreaks:

- **Vector Control:** Implement rigorous flea and rodent control measures to reduce the spread of Yersinia pestis.
  
- **Early Diagnosis and Treatment:** Enhance laboratory capacity and healthcare provider training to promptly diagnose and treat suspected cases.
  
- **Public Awareness:** Conduct regular public education campaigns on plague symptoms, transmission routes, and preventive measures such as avoiding contact with rodents and maintaining hygiene.

### International Collaboration

The World Health Organization (WHO) provided technical assistance and expertise to India during the 1994 Plague outbreak. In this aspect, WHO’s assistance involved screening of disease outbreaks, education of human resource in health, and organization of global humanitarian response for the needy populations.

# SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) 2002-2004

### Origin and Symptoms

Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), caused by the SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV), emerged in Guangdong Province, China, in late 2002. The virus quickly spread to other countries through international travel, leading to a global outbreak. SARS is characterized by flu-like symptoms such as high fever, dry cough, difficulty breathing, and in severe cases, pneumonia. It spread fast particularly within health facilities, which made the efforts to control it rather challenging.

### Effects on Society

The SARS outbreak had profound socio-economic impacts worldwide, including in India. Fear and uncertainty gripped communities as the virus spread rapidly, prompting governments to implement stringent quarantine measures and travel restrictions. In India, public anxiety was heightened by imported cases, leading to disruptions in trade, tourism, and daily life. The health sector was under intense pressure, hospitals getting congested with patients, as maximum healthcare personnel were at risk due to ill protection during the initial days.

- **Economic Disruption:** Industries reliant on international trade and tourism suffered significant losses as travel advisories and restrictions were imposed.
- **Social Distancing:** Public gatherings were restricted, affecting cultural events, religious gatherings, and community activities.
