<h2 id="about">About</h2>
<p>The term COPD is used to describe a group of lung disorders that worsen with time. COPD can be brought on by emphysema or chronic bronchitis. You may have symptoms of both of these lung-damaging illnesses, or you may have one of them if you have been diagnosed with COPD. Breathing may become more difficult as COPD worsens over time.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Chronic bronchitis</p>
<p>  Your bronchial tubes, which transport air to and from your lungs, become irritated by chronic bronchitis. The tubes enlarge as a result, and mucus, sometimes known as &quot;snot,&quot; accumulates along the lining. The accumulation makes it more difficult to breathe in and out of your lungs because it narrows the tube&#39;s entrance. Mucus is typically removed from your airways by tiny, hair-like structures called cilia that are found inside your bronchial tubes. However, smoking and/or chronic bronchitis irritate them. Damaged cilia are unable to aid in mucus clearance.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Emphysema</p>
<p>  The collapse of the walls of the small air sacs (alveoli) at the terminus of the bronchial tubes, in the &quot;bottom&quot; of the lung, is known as emphysema. Your lung resembles an inverted tree. The leaves represent the air sacs, or &quot;alveoli,&quot; the branches are the &quot;bronchi,&quot; and the stem is the windpipe, or &quot;trachea.&quot; The air sacs are essential for the movement of carbon dioxide out of your body and oxygen into it. It is difficult to take a deep breath because of the damage that emphysema causes to the air sac walls.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="symptoms">Symptoms</h2>
<p>COPD symptoms often don&#39;t appear until significant lung damage has occurred, and they usually worsen over time, particularly if smoking exposure continues.</p>
<p>Signs and symptoms of COPD may include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Shortness of breath, especially during physical activities</li>
<li>Wheezing</li>
<li>Chest tightness</li>
<li>A chronic cough that may produce mucus (sputum) that may be clear, white, yellow or greenish</li>
<li>Frequent respiratory infections</li>
<li>Lack of energy</li>
<li>Unintended weight loss (in later stages)</li>
<li>Swelling in ankles, feet or legs</li>
</ul>
<p>People with COPD are also likely to experience episodes called exacerbations, during which their symptoms become worse than the usual day-to-day variation and persist for at least several days.</p>
<h2 id="causes">Causes</h2>
<p>Tobacco smoking is the leading cause of COPD in industrialized nations. COPD is common in the developing world among people who are exposed to pollutants from cooking and heating fuel in inadequately ventilated houses. Only a small percentage of chronic smokers acquire clinically evident COPD, however many smokers with extended smoking histories may experience impaired lung function. Some smokers acquire uncommon lung problems. They may be misdiagnosed as COPD unless a more complete evaluation is conducted.</p>
<h4 id="-airway-obstruction">- Airway obstruction</h4>
<p>The causes of airway blockage include:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Emphysema - This lung disease destroys the delicate walls and elastic fibers of the alveoli. When you exhale, small airways collapse, reducing airflow from your lungs.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Chronic bronchitis - In this disease, your bronchial tubes become inflamed and narrower, and your lungs generate more mucus, which can clog the restricted tubes. You acquire a persistent cough while trying to clean your airways.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="-cigarette-smoke-and-other-allergens">- Cigarette smoke and other allergens</h4>
<p>The great majority of persons with COPD get the disease as a result of long-term cigarette smoking. However, because not all smokers acquire COPD, other variables, such as genetic vulnerability to the illness, are likely to play a role. Other irritants that can develop COPD include cigar smoke, secondhand smoke, pipe smoke, air pollution, and occupational exposure to dust, smoke, or fumes.</p>
<h4 id="-alpha-1-antitrypsin-deficiency">- Alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency</h4>
<p>About 1% of COPD patients have a genetic condition that produces low levels of a protein known as alpha-1-antitrypsin (AAt). The liver produces AAt, which is then released into the circulation to assist protect the lungs. Alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency can result in liver illness, lung disease, or both. Adults with COPD caused by AAt deficiency have treatment choices similar to those utilized for more prevalent kinds of COPD. Furthermore, some persons can be treated by restoring the missing AAt protein, perhaps preventing additional lung damage.</p>

</code></pre><p>The World Health Organization (WHO) reports that COPD was the third most common cause of death globally in 2019 with <code>3.23 million</code> deaths attributed to it. According to Dr. Schachter, <code>COPD is the fourth leading causeTrusted Source of death</code> in the US. Additionally, &quot;millionsTrusted Source more people may be undiagnosed,&quot; according to Dr. Yadegar, who spoke with Medical News Today.</p>
<p>If you are experiencing any of the following symptoms of COPD: <code>persistent cough, dyspnea, recurrent respiratory infections, high mucus production (also known as phlegm or sputum), and/or wheezing</code>, the American Lung Association (ALA) advises speaking with a physician about getting a breathing test known as &quot;spirometry,&quot; which can help diagnose COPD.</p>
<h3 id="2-only-smokers-develop-copd">2. Only smokers develop COPD</h3>
<pre><code>Fact: Although smoking <span class="hljs-keyword">is</span> a leading cause <span class="hljs-keyword">of</span> COPD, people who have never smoked can also develop <span class="hljs-keyword">it</span>.
</code></pre><p><code>Ten to twenty percent of people with COPD never smoked</code>. major exposure to secondhand smoke, a genetic predisposition predominantly resulting from alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency, or a major exposure to air pollution are among the factors contributing to the non-smoking population.</p>
<p>An enzyme called <code>alpha-1 antitrypsin</code> defends the body against an immunological assault. Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency is brought on by a mutation in the gene that codes for this enzyme in certain individuals. Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency raises the possibility of COPD and other disorders affecting several body systems.</p>
<p>Risk factors for COPD include:</p>
<ul>
<li>current or past smoking</li>

Young individuals who have a history of smoking or who have been around secondhand smoke are far more likely to develop COPD.</p>
<h3 id="4-copd-is-a-man-s-disease">4. COPD is a manâ€™s disease</h3>
<pre><code>Fact: The CDCTrusted Source reports <span class="hljs-keyword">that</span> more women than men are living <span class="hljs-keyword">with</span> COPD
</code></pre><p>Since 2000, COPD has claimed the lives of more women than males in the US. While exposure to other pollutants, such as tobacco smoke, increases the risk of COPD in individuals of any gender, women may be more negatively impacted by these pollutants than males are. In addition, women with COPD typically receive a diagnosis later than males, when the illness has worsened and treatment options have become less successful. This might be a factor in women with COPD having worse survival rates.</p>
<h3 id="5-nothing-can-be-done-to-treat-copd">5. Nothing can be done to treat COPD</h3>
<pre><code>Fact: COPD treatments are available <span class="hljs-built_in">to</span> help limit symptoms <span class="hljs-keyword">and</span> potentially slow <span class="hljs-keyword">the</span> progression <span class="hljs-keyword">of</span> COPD.

<h2 id="living-well-with-copd">Living well with COPD</h2>
<p>There is no cure for COPD, but it may be controlled and treated by collaborating with your healthcare team to create a strategy to keep your condition under control. Along with stopping smoking, being up to date on vaccines, sticking to your treatment plan, and visiting your doctor on a regular basis, there are lifestyle modifications that can help you stay more active and enhance your overall quality of life.</p>
<h4 id="exercise">Exercise</h4>
<p>When you are suffering from lung disease or COPD, exercise can often be the last thing you feel like doing. Exercise raises your heart rate and causes you to breathe more heavily, to take in more oxygen that is then distributed throughout the bloodstream into our muscles. This need to breathe more can cause concern for people with lung disease or COPD.However, numerous studies have found that exercise is highly beneficial for people living with lung disease. Regular exercise can actually reduce your symptoms, as well as maintaining your general health and wellbeing. Itâ€™s important that lung disease doesnâ€™t get in the way of you being able to enjoy life and doing the things you normally would, like going for a walk with friends, playing with kids, or doing chores around the house.</p>
<p>Some of the benefits of exercise for people with lung disease or COPD include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Improved strength in your muscles, including your arms and legs</li>
<li>Improved balance, reducing the risk of falls</li>
<li>Prevents unplanned weight gain</li>
<li>Improved bone density</li>
<li>Reduces breathlessness</li>
<li>Allows patients to do everyday tasks, such as household chores, more easily</li>
<li>Improves mood and reduces the risk of depression and anxiety</li>
</ul>
<p>Some good options for people living with lung disease of COPD include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Walking</li>
<li>Cycling</li>
<li>Swimming</li>
<li>Jogging</li>
<li>Roller skating</li>
<li>Pilates</li>
<li>Yoga</li>
<li>Low-impact aerobics</li>
<li>Resistance training</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="home-care">Home Care</h4>
<p>As your COPD advances, you may find it increasingly difficult to do everyday duties, even with the assistance of energy conservation and breathing methods. In the late stages of COPD, home care can be an essential component of your treatment strategy. These services might include home activities or medical care, both of which can assist alleviate the stress on you and your family members.</p>
<h4 id="breathing-techniques">Breathing techniques</h4>
<p>In addition to regular exercise to strengthen your heart and lungs, your care plan should also include some form of pulmonary therapy or rehabilitation. In these classes, youâ€™ll learn breathing techniques such as pursed-lip breathing that can help when you find yourself short of breath. Youâ€™ll also get tips on getting the right nutrition and exercise for your condition.</p>
<h4 id="energy-conservation-techniques">Energy conservation techniques</h4>
<p>Severe shortness of breath can make it difficult to carry out your daily activities, but keeping your independence is still important if you have COPD. A doctor should discuss with you, and include in your care plan, techniques that can help you make it through your day without wasting energy. These techniques can help you do everyday tasks â€” such as putting away laundry or cooking dinner â€” in a way thatâ€™s coordinated with your breathing to help you get the job done without an exacerbation of your symptoms</p>
<h2 id="syndrome">Syndrome</h2>
<p>COPD is largely defined by chronic bronchitis and emphysema, which produce persistent airflow restriction, making it difficult to breathe. Symptoms include a persistent cough with mucus production, shortness of breath, wheezing, and chest tightness. These symptoms usually intensify over time and can severely limit daily activities and general quality of life. COPD is frequently connected with long-term exposure to irritating gases or particulate matter, most notably from cigarette smoke, but also from environmental contaminants or occupational dangers. Because COPD is a progressive illness, early detection and care are critical for slowing its development and relieving symptoms. Medication, pulmonary rehabilitation, lifestyle modifications such as quitting smoking, and, in extreme situations, oxygen therapy or surgery are all possible treatment options. </p>
<h2 id="social-awareness">Social Awareness</h2>
<p>Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is a critical public health concern that demands increased social awareness. COPD is a progressive lung disease that includes conditions such as emphysema and chronic bronchitis, leading to breathing difficulties and significantly affecting the quality of life. Despite its widespread occurrence, the general public still has a poor grasp and awareness of the condition. Raising awareness of COPD is critical for early detection and successful treatment. Public education programs can help individuals notice signs like persistent cough and shortness of breath, allowing them to seek medical assistance sooner. Furthermore, recognizing the risk factors, including as smoking, long-term exposure to air pollution, and genetic predispositions, might lead to preventative actions and lifestyle modifications that minimize the prevalence of COPD. We can help individuals impacted by COPD by developing a more informed community, promoting early intervention, and advocating for better healthcare resources and legislation to manage this crippling illness.</p>
<h3 id="significant-steps-taken-to-raise-awareness-and-combat-copd-">Significant Steps Taken to Raise Awareness and Combat COPD:</h3>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Public Health Campaigns:</strong> Governments and health organizations have launched awareness campaigns to educate the public about COPD symptoms, risk factors, and the importance of early diagnosis.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>World COPD Day:</strong> Observed annually in November, this event focuses on raising global awareness and improving COPD care through various activities and informational sessions.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Smoking Cessation Programs:</strong> Efforts to reduce smoking, a leading cause of COPD, include public service announcements, support groups, and accessible smoking cessation resources.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Air Quality Initiatives:</strong> Policies aimed at reducing air pollution, such as stricter emissions regulations and promoting clean energy sources, help lower the risk of COPD.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Patient Support Networks:</strong> Establishing support groups and online communities for COPD patients and their families provides essential emotional support and practical advice for managing the disease.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Research and Funding:</strong> Increased funding for research into COPD treatments and potential cures, along with the development of new medications and therapies, plays a vital role in combating the disease.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>By continuing these efforts and fostering greater social awareness, we can make significant strides in the fight against COPD, ultimately improving the lives of those affected.</p>
<h2 id="key-facts">Key facts</h2>
