<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>The idea of being possessed by ghosts or spirits has been a part of human culture for centuries, appearing in various forms across different societies. While some view possession as a supernatural phenomenon, modern psychology often interprets these experiences through the lens of mental health disorders. This article explores whether people are truly possessed by ghosts or if these experiences can be explained by mental disorders.</p>
<h2 id="historical-and-cultural-perspectives-on-possession">Historical and Cultural Perspectives on Possession</h2>
<p>Possession by ghosts or spirits is a concept deeply rooted in many cultures. In ancient civilizations, such as those in Egypt, Greece, and Rome, possession was often seen as divine or demonic intervention. Similarly, many indigenous cultures have their own interpretations of possession, often tied to religious or spiritual beliefs.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Ancient Civilizations:</strong> In ancient Greece, the Oracle of Delphi was believed to be possessed by the god Apollo to deliver prophecies.</li>
<li><strong>Indigenous Beliefs:</strong> Many indigenous cultures, such as the Shamanistic traditions, view possession as a means of communication with the spirit world.</li>
<li><strong>Religious Contexts:</strong> In Christianity, possession is often associated with demonic influence and requires exorcism.</li>
</ul>

</ul>
