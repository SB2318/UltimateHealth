<h2 id="about">About</h2>
<p><strong>Dehydration</strong> occurs when you use or lose more fluid than you take in, and your body doesn&#39;t have enough water and other fluids to carry out its normal functions. If you don&#39;t replace lost fluids, you will get dehydrated.</p>
<p>Anyone may become dehydrated, but the condition is especially dangerous for young children and older adults.</p>
<p>Dehydration occurs when your body does not have as much water and fluids as it needs.</p>
<p>Dehydration can be mild, moderate, or severe, based on how much of your body&#39;s fluid is lost or not replaced. Severe dehydration is a life-threatening emergency.</p>
<p>The most common cause of dehydration in young children is severe diarrhea and vomiting. Older adults naturally have a lower volume of water in their bodies, and may have conditions or take medications that increase the risk of dehydration.</p>
<p>This means that even minor illnesses, such as infections affecting the lungs or bladder, can result in dehydration in older adults.</p>
<p>Dehydration also can occur in any age group if you don&#39;t drink enough water during hot weather — especially if you are exercising vigorously.</p>

<h2 id="dehydration-symptoms">Dehydration Symptoms</h2>
<p>Thirst isn&#39;t always a reliable early indicator of the body&#39;s need for water. Many people, particularly older adults, don&#39;t feel thirsty until they&#39;re already dehydrated. That&#39;s why it&#39;s important to increase water intake during hot weather or when you&#39;re ill.</p>
<p>The signs and symptoms of dehydration also may differ by age.
<strong>Infant or young child</strong></p>
<p>  ➣ Dry mouth and tongue
  ➣ No tears when crying
  ➣ No wet diapers for three hours
  ➣ Sunken eyes, cheeks
  ➣ Sunken soft spot on top of skull
  ➣ Listlessness or irritability</p>
<p><strong>Adult</strong></p>
<p>  ➣ Extreme thirst
  ➣ Less frequent urination
  ➣ Dark-colored urine
  ➣ Fatigue
  ➣ Dizziness
  ➣ Confusion</p>
<p><strong>When to see a doctor</strong></p>
<p>Call your family doctor if you or a loved one:</p>
<p>  ➣ Has had diarrhea for 24 hours or more
  ➣ Is irritable or disoriented and much sleepier or less active than usual
  ➣ Can&#39;t keep down fluids
  ➣ Has bloody or black stool</p>
<p><strong>Signs of severe dehydration include:</strong></p>
<p>  ➣ Not urinating, or very dark yellow or amber-colored urine
  ➣ Dry, shriveled skin
  ➣ Irritability or confusion
  ➣ Dizziness or lightheadedness
  ➣ Rapid heartbeat
  ➣ Rapid breathing
  ➣ Sunken eyes
  ➣ Listlessness
  ➣ Shock (not enough blood flow through the body)
  ➣ Unconsciousness or delirium </p>
<h2 id="causes">Causes</h2>
<p>Sometimes dehydration occurs for simple reasons: You don&#39;t drink enough because you&#39;re sick or busy, or because you lack access to safe drinking water when you&#39;re traveling, hiking or camping.</p>
<p>Other dehydration causes include:</p>
<p>  ▸ Diarrhea, vomiting. Severe, acute diarrhea — that is, diarrhea that comes on suddenly and violently — can cause a tremendous loss of water and electrolytes in a short amount of time. If you have vomiting along with diarrhea, you lose even more fluids and minerals.
  ▸ Fever. In general, the higher your fever, the more dehydrated you may become. The problem worsens if you have a fever in addition to diarrhea and vomiting.
  ▸ Excessive sweating. You lose water when you sweat. If you do vigorous activity and don&#39;t replace fluids as you go along, you can become dehydrated. Hot, humid weather increases the amount you sweat and the amount of fluid you lose.
  ▸ Increased urination. This may be due to undiagnosed or uncontrolled diabetes. Certain medications, such as diuretics and some blood pressure medications, also can lead to dehydration, generally because they cause you to urinate more.</p>
<h3 id="risk-factors">Risk factors</h3>
<p>Anyone can become dehydrated, but certain people are at greater risk:</p>
<p>  ▸ <strong>Infants and children</strong> The most likely group to experience severe diarrhea and vomiting, infants and children are especially vulnerable to dehydration. Having a higher surface area to volume area, they also lose a higher proportion of their fluids from a high fever or burns. Young children often can&#39;t tell you that they&#39;re thirsty, nor can they get a drink for themselves.
  ▸ <strong>Older adults</strong> As you age, your body&#39;s fluid reserve becomes smaller, your ability to conserve water is reduced and your thirst sense becomes less acute. These problems are compounded by chronic illnesses such as diabetes and dementia, and by the use of certain medications. Older adults also may have mobility problems that limit their ability to obtain water for themselves.
  ▸ <strong>People with chronic illnesses</strong> Having uncontrolled or untreated diabetes puts you at high risk of dehydration. Kidney disease also increases your risk, as do medications that increase urination. Even having a cold or sore throat makes you more susceptible to dehydration because you&#39;re less likely to feel like eating or drinking when you&#39;re sick.
  ▸ <strong>People who work or exercise outside</strong> When it&#39;s hot and humid, your risk of dehydration and heat illness increases. That&#39;s because when the air is humid, sweat can&#39;t evaporate and cool you as quickly as it normally does, and this can lead to an increased body temperature and the need for more fluids.</p>
<h3 id="complications">Complications</h3>
<p><strong>Dehydration</strong> can lead to serious complications, including:</p>
<p>  ▸ Heat injury - If you don&#39;t drink enough fluids when you&#39;re exercising vigorously and perspiring heavily, you may end up with a heat injury, ranging in severity from mild heat cramps to heat exhaustion or potentially life-threatening heatstroke.
  ▸ Urinary and kidney problems - Prolonged or repeated bouts of dehydration can cause urinary tract infections, kidney stones and even kidney failure.
  ▸ Seizures - Electrolytes such as potassium and sodium — help carry electrical signals from cell to cell. If your electrolytes are out of balance, the normal electrical messages can become mixed up, which can lead to involuntary muscle contractions and sometimes to a loss of consciousness.
  ▸ Low blood volume shock (hypovolemic shock). This is one of the most serious, and sometimes life-threatening, complications of dehydration. It occurs when low blood volume causes a drop in blood pressure and a drop in the amount of oxygen in your body.</p>

<h2 id="prevention">Prevention</h2>
<p>To prevent dehydration:</p>
<p>  ▸ Drink plenty of fluids every day, even when you are well. Drink more when the weather is hot or you are exercising.
  ▸ If anyone in your family is ill, pay attention to how much they are able to drink. Pay close attention to children and older adults.
  ▸ Anyone with a fever, vomiting, or diarrhea should drink plenty of fluids. DO NOT wait for signs of dehydration.
  ▸ If you think you or someone in your family may become dehydrated, call your provider. Do this before the person becomes dehydrated. </p>
<h2 id="home-care-treatment">Home Care &amp; Treatment</h2>
<p>To prevent dehydration, drink plenty of fluids and eat foods high in water such as fruits and vegetables. Letting thirst be your guide is an adequate daily guideline for most healthy people.</p>
<p>People may need to take in more fluids if they are experiencing conditions such as:</p>
<p>  ▸ Vomiting or diarrhea. If your child is vomiting or has diarrhea, start giving extra water or an oral rehydration solution at the first signs of illness. Don&#39;t wait until dehydration occurs.
  ▸ Strenuous exercise. In general, it&#39;s best to start hydrating the day before strenuous exercise. Producing lots of clear, dilute urine is a good indication that you&#39;re well-hydrated. During the activity, replenish fluids at regular intervals and continue drinking water or other fluids after you&#39;re finished.
  ▸ Hot or cold weather. You need to drink additional water in hot or humid weather to help lower your body temperature and to replace what you lose through sweating. You may also need extra water in cold weather to combat moisture loss from dry air, particularly at higher altitudes
  ▸ Illness. Older adults most commonly become dehydrated during minor illnesses — such as influenza, bronchitis or bladder infections. Make sure to drink extra fluids when you&#39;re not feeling well.
  ▸ Try sipping water or sucking on ice cubes.
  ▸ Try drinking water or sports drinks that contain electrolytes.
  ▸ Do not take salt tablets. They can cause serious complications.
  ▸ Ask your provider what you should eat if you have diarrhea. </p>
<p>For more severe dehydration or heat emergency, you may need to stay in a hospital and receive fluid through a vein (IV). The provider will also treat the cause of the dehydration.</p>
<p>Dehydration caused by a stomach or intestinal virus should get better on its own after a few days. </p>

<h2 id="when-to-contact-a-medical-professional-">When to Contact a Medical Professional?</h2>
<p>You should call 911 or the local emergency number if:</p>
<p>  ▸ The person loses consciousness at any time.
  ▸ There is any other change in the person&#39;s alertness (for example, confusion or seizures).
  ▸ The person has a fever over 102°F (38.8°C).
  ▸ You notice symptoms of heatstroke (such as rapid pulse or rapid breathing).
  ▸ The person&#39;s condition does not improve or gets worse despite treatment</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Dehydration is a critical but often overlooked health issue that can have profound effects on the body and mind. It is essential to recognize the signs and symptoms of dehydration, which can range from mild thirst to severe complications such as kidney stones and heatstroke. Preventive measures are simple yet effective. Drinking water regularly, especially during hot weather or strenuous activities, consuming water-rich foods, and avoiding excessive intake of diuretics like caffeine and alcohol can help maintain proper hydration levels. Monitoring urine color and staying attuned to bodily signals can also aid in identifying early signs of dehydration.</p>
<p>Understanding the importance of hydration and integrating healthy hydration habits into daily life can significantly improve overall health and well-being. By staying informed and proactive, we can mitigate the silent threat of dehydration and ensure our bodies function optimally. Prioritizing hydration is not just a health choice but a fundamental step towards a healthier and more vibrant life.</p>
