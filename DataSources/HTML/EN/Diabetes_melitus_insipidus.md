<h2 id="abstract">Abstract</h2>
<p>The Latin terms diabetes means “a siphon” or “passer through”. Insipidus implies “tasteless”, and mellitus “honeyed”.
Diabetes is a disease that occurs when your blood glucose, also called blood sugar, is too high. Glucose is your body’s main source of energy. Your body can make glucose, but glucose also comes from the food you eat.</p>
<p><strong>Diabetes mellitus</strong> (DM) is a metabolic disease, involving inappropriately elevated blood glucose levels. DM has several categories, including type 1, type 2, maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY), gestational diabetes, neonatal diabetes, and secondary causes due to endocrinopathies, steroid use, etc. The main subtypes of DM are Type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) and Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), which classically result from defective insulin secretion (T1DM) and/or action (T2DM).</p>
<p><strong>Diabetes insipidus</strong> is a rare disorder that causes the body to make too much urine. While most people make 1 to 3 quarts of urine a day, people with diabetes insipidus can make up to 20 quarts of urine a day. People with this disorder need to urinate frequently, called polyuria. They may also feel thirsty all the time and drink lots of liquids, a condition called polydipsia.</p>

<td style="text-align:left">The term &quot;diabetes&quot; was first coined by Araetus of Cappodocia (81-133AD). Later, the word mellitus (honey sweet) was added by Thomas Willis (Britain) in 1675 after rediscovering the sweetness of urine and blood of patients (first noticed by the ancient Indians).The reason of this diabetes is defficiency of Pancreatic beta cells (Type 1) or insulin resistance (Type 2).</td>
<td style="text-align:left">Diabetes insipidus is an ancient disease considered under the rubric of diabetes, the Greek descriptive term for polyuria, which was unrecognized even after the sweetness of urine was reported as a characteristic of diabetes mellitus in the 17th century. It would be another century before diabetes insipidus was identified from the insipid rather than saccharine taste of urine in cases of polyuria. After its increased recognition, pathologic observations and experimental studies connected diabetes insipidus to the pituitary gland  to be vasoconstrictive (vasopressin) and antidiuretic (antidiuretic hormone).</td>

<td style="text-align:left"><strong>Diabetes mellitus</strong> occurs when your immune system, the body’s system for fighting infection, attacks and destroys the insulin-producing beta cells of the pancreas. Scientists think type 1 diabetes is caused by genes and environmental factors, such as viruses, that might trigger the disease. Also most common form of diabetes—is caused by several factors, including lifestyle factors and genes. Overweight, obesity, and physical inactivity You are more likely to develop diabetes if you are not physically active and are overweight or have obesity. Extra weight sometimes causes insulin resistance and is common in people with type 2 diabetes. The location of body fat also makes a difference. Extra belly fat is linked to insulin resistance, heart and blood vessel disease. Diabetes usually begins with insulin resistance, a condition in which muscle, liver, and fat cells do not use insulin well. As a result, your body needs more insulin to help glucose enter cells. At first, the pancreas makes more insulin to keep up with the added demand. Over time, the pancreas can’t make enough insulin, and blood glucose levels rise.</td>
<td style="text-align:left"><strong>Diabetes insipidus</strong> is caused by problems with a chemical called arginine vasopressin (AVP), which is also known as antidiuretic hormone (ADH).AVP is produced by the hypothalamus and stored in the pituitary gland until needed. The hypothalamus is an area of the brain that controls mood and appetite. The pituitary gland is located below your brain, behind the bridge of your nose. AVP regulates the level of water in your body by controlling the amount of urine your kidneys produce. When the level of water in your body decreases, your pituitary gland releases AVP to conserve water and stop the production of urine. In diabetes insipidus, AVP fails to properly regulate your body&#39;s level of water, and allows too much urine to be produced and passed from your body.</td>

<h2 id="symptoms">Symptoms</h2>
<h3 id="diabetes-mellitus">Diabetes mellitus</h3>
<p>The classic symptoms of <strong>Diabetes mellitus</strong> are polyuria, thirst, and weight loss. Several other non-specific signs and symptoms may also occur, including fatigue, blurred vision, and genital itchiness due to Candida infection. About half of affected individuals may also be asymptomatic. Type 1 presents abruptly following a pre-clinical phase, while type 2 has a more insidious onset; patients may remain asymptomatic for many years.</p>
<p>Diabetic ketoacidosis is a medical emergency that occurs most commonly in type 1, but may also occur in type 2 if it has been longstanding or if the individual has significant β-cell dysfunction. Excessive production of ketone bodies leads to signs and symptoms including nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, the smell of acetone in the breath, deep breathing known as Kussmaul breathing, and in severe cases decreased level of consciousness. Hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state is another emergency characterized by dehydration secondary to severe hyperglycemia, with resultant hypernatremia leading to an altered mental state and possibly coma.</p>
<p>Hypoglycemia is a recognized complication of insulin treatment used in diabetes. An acute presentation can include mild symptoms such as sweating, trembling, and palpitations, to more serious effects including impaired cognition, confusion, seizures, coma, and rarely death. Recurrent hypoglycemic episodes may lower the glycemic threshold at which symptoms occur, meaning mild symptoms may not appear before cognitive deterioration begins to occur.</p>

<h3 id="diabetes-insipidus">Diabetes insipidus</h3>
<p><strong>Diabetes insipidus</strong> is caused by problems with a chemical called arginine vasopressin (AVP), which is also known as antidiuretic hormone (ADH).
AVP is produced by the hypothalamus and stored in the pituitary gland until needed. The hypothalamus is an area of the brain that controls mood and appetite. The pituitary gland is located below your brain, behind the bridge of your nose. AVP regulates the level of water in your body by controlling the amount of urine your kidneys produce.
When the level of water in your body decreases, your pituitary gland releases AVP to conserve water and stop the production of urine.
There are 2 main types of diabetes insipidus:
   1- <strong>AVP deficiency(AVP-D)</strong>:
   A brain tumour that damages the hypothalamus or pituitary gland, severe head injury that damages the hypothalamus or pituitary gland
   complications that occur during brain or pituitary surgery
   No cause can be found for about a third of all cases of AVP-D.
   These cases, known as idiopathic, appear to be related to the immune system attacking the normal healthy cells producing AVP.
   Less common causes of AVP-D include:
   cancers that spread from another part of the body to the brain,Wolfram syndrome, a rare genetic disorder that also causes vision loss, brain damage caused by a sudden loss of oxygen, which can occur during a stroke or drowning infections, such as meningitis and encephalitis, that can damage the brain</p>
<p>   2- <strong>AVP resistance (AVP-R)</strong>:
   Your kidneys contain nephrons, which are tiny intricate structures that filter waste products from the blood and help produce urine.They also control how much water is reabsorbed into your body and how much is passed in the urine when you pee.
   In a healthy person, AVP acts as a signal to the nephrons to reabsorb water into the body.
   In AVP-R, the nephrons in the kidneys are not able to respond to this signal, leading to excessive water loss in large amounts of urine. Your thirst increases to try to balance this loss from the body.
   AVP-R can be present at birth (congenital) or develop later in life as a result of an external factor (acquired).
   <strong>Congenital AVP-R</strong>
   Two abnormal changes in genes that lead to them not working properly (genetic mutations) have been identified that cause congenital AVP-R.
   The first, known as the AVPR2 gene mutation, is responsible for 90% of all cases. But it&#39;s still rare, occurring in an estimated 1 in 250,000 births. The AVPR2 gene mutation affects the X sex chromosome.
   Women have 2 X chromosomes, which means women with this gene mutation may have no symptoms, as usually only 1 of their X chromosomes is affected. Men have only 1 X chromosome, so men with this gene mutation are more likely to have symptoms. The remaining 10% of cases of congenital AVP-R are caused by the AQP2 gene mutation, which can affect both males and females.
   Lithium is the most common cause of acquired AVP-R. It&#39;s a medication often used to treat bipolar disorder. Long-term lithium use can damage the cells of the kidneys so they no longer respond to AVP.
   Other causes of acquired AVP-R include:
   hypercalcaemia – a condition where there&#39;s too much calcium in the blood (high calcium levels can damage the kidneys)
   hypokalemia – a condition where there&#39;s not enough potassium in the blood (all the cells in the body, including kidney cells, require potassium to function properly)
   pyelonephritis (kidney infection) – where the kidneys are damaged by an infection
   ureteral obstruction – where 1 or both tubes that connect the kidneys to the bladder (ureters) become blocked by an object, such as a kidney stone, which damages the kidneys</p>

<h2 id="what-are-the-complications-of-diabetes-">What are the complications of diabetes?</h2>
<h2 id="complication-of-diabetes-mellitus">Complication of Diabetes mellitus</h2>
<p>Long-term complications of diabetes develop gradually. The longer you have diabetes — and the less controlled your blood sugar — the higher the risk of complications. Eventually, diabetes complications may be disabling or even life-threatening. In fact, prediabetes can lead to type 2 diabetes. Possible complications include:</p>
<p>   ➤ Heart and blood vessel (cardiovascular) disease. Diabetes majorly increases the risk of many heart problems. These can include coronary artery disease with chest pain (angina), heart attack, stroke and narrowing of arteries (atherosclerosis). If you have diabetes, you&#39;re more likely to have heart disease or stroke.</p>
<p>   ➤ Nerve damage from diabetes (diabetic neuropathy). Too much sugar can injure the walls of the tiny blood vessels (capillaries) that nourish the nerves, especially in the legs. This can cause tingling, numbness, burning or pain that usually begins at the tips of the toes or fingers and gradually spreads upward.</p>
<p>   ➤ Damage to the nerves related to digestion can cause problems with nausea, vomiting, diarrhea or constipation. For men, it may lead to erectile dysfunction.</p>
<p>   ➤ Kidney damage from diabetes (diabetic nephropathy). The kidneys hold millions of tiny blood vessel clusters (glomeruli) that filter waste from the blood. Diabetes can damage this delicate filtering system.</p>
<p>   ➤ Eye damage from diabetes (diabetic retinopathy). Diabetes can damage the blood vessels of the eye. This could lead to blindness.
    Foot damage. Nerve damage in the feet or poor blood flow to the feet increases the risk of many foot complications.
    Skin and mouth conditions. Diabetes may leave you more prone to skin problems, including bacterial and fungal infections.
    Hearing impairment. Hearing problems are more common in people with diabetes.</p>
<p>   ➤ Alzheimer&#39;s disease. Type 2 diabetes may increase the risk of dementia, such as Alzheimer&#39;s disease.</p>
<p>   ➤ Depression related to diabetes. Depression symptoms are common in people with type 1 and type 2 diabetes.</p>
<h2 id="complication-of-diabetes-insipidus">Complication of Diabetes insipidus</h2>
<p>The main complication of diabetes insipidus is dehydration, which happens when your body loses too much fluid and electrolytes to work properly. If you have diabetes insipidus, you can usually make up for the large amount of fluids you pass in your urine by drinking more liquids. But if you don’t, you could quickly become dehydrated.
Symptoms of dehydration may include
   ▸ thirst
   ▸ dry mouth
   ▸ feeling dizzy or light-headed when standing
   ▸ feeling tired
   ▸ difficulty performing simple mental tasks
   ▸ nausea
   ▸ fainting</p>
<p>Severe dehydration can lead to seizures, permanent brain damage, and even death. Seek care right away if you feel</p>
<p>   ▸ confused
   ▸ dizzy
   ▸ sluggish</p>

<p> ➤ Metformin — Most people who are newly diagnosed with type 2 diabetes will immediately begin a medicine called metformin. Metformin improves your body&#39;s response to insulin and, as a result, lowers blood sugar levels.</p>
<p> ➤ Sulfonylureas have been used to treat type 2 diabetes for many years. They work by increasing the amount of insulin your body makes and can lower blood sugar levels by approximately 20 percent. </p>
<p> ➤ Insulin administration is the fundamental treatment of type 1 diabetes mellitus. Although insulin has been available for more than 75 years, in the last two decades there have been important changes due to the generalized use of reflectometers by patients to self-monitor capillary blood glucose. </p>
<h4 id="diabetes-insipidus">Diabetes insipidus</h4>
<p> ➤ The main way to treat diabetes insipidus is to drink enough liquids to prevent dehydration. But doing so can disrupt your regular lifestyle, including your sleep. Your health care professional may refer you to a specialist, such as a nephrologist or an endocrinologist for more specific treatments. Other treatments vary by cause.</p>
<p> ➤ Health care professionals most often treat <strong>central diabetes</strong> insipidus with a man-made hormone called desmopressin NIH external link, which replaces the vasopressin your body is not making.2,6 You can take this medicine as a nasal spray, a pill, or a shot.</p>
<p> ➤ In some cases, <strong>nephrogenic diabetes</strong> insipidus may go away after treating its cause. For example, switching medicines or taking steps to balance the amount of calcium or potassium in your body may be enough to resolve the problem. Your health care professional may also prescribe a class of diuretic medicines called thiazides to help reduce the amount of urine your kidneys make.2,7 Other treatments can include nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or other types of diuretics.</p>
<p> ➤ Researchers haven’t found an effective way to treat <strong>dipsogenic diabetes</strong> insipidus. Sucking on ice chips or sugar free candies to moisten your mouth and increase saliva flow may help reduce your thirst. If you wake up many times at night to urinate, your health care professional may suggest you take a small dose of desmopressin at bedtime. Your health care professional may also monitor your blood levels of sodium, which can drop too low if you have this condition.
Gestational diabetes insipidus.</p>
<p> ➤ Health care professionals treat <strong>gestational diabetes</strong> insipidus with desmopressin, which is safe for both mother and baby. An expectant mother’s placenta does not destroy desmopressin as it does vasopressin. Gestational diabetes insipidus usually goes away after the baby is born, but may return if the mother becomes pregnant again.</p>
<p>Most people with <strong>diabetes insipidus</strong> can prevent serious problems and live a normal life if they follow their health care professional’s recommendations and keep their symptoms under control.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="pathophysiology-of-diabetes-mellitus-vs-diabetes-insipidus">Pathophysiology of diabetes mellitus vs Diabetes insipidus</h2>
<p>The pathophysiology of diabetes is related to the levels of insulin within the body, and the body&#39;s ability to utilize insulin. There is a direct link between hyperglycemia and physiological &amp; behavioral responses. Whenever there is hyperglycemia, the brain recognizes it and send a message through nerve impulses to pancreas
and other organs to decrease its effect.</p>

<h2 id="prognosis">Prognosis</h2>
<h3 id="prognosis-of-diabetes-mellitus">Prognosis of diabetes mellitus</h3>
<p>The centralised registration and care of all diabetics in a geographically defined population has provided an epidemiological basis for a longitudinal investigation of the prognosis of this disease. Records of all newly diagnosed diabetics who had been registered in the Erfurt district (population 1.25 million) in 1966 were studied in relation to the time period 1966–1976. Of the known 2,560 diabetics (910 men, 1,650 women; 93.7% &gt;40 years of age), 1,054 had died during the 10-year follow-up period. Cardiovascular causes accounted for the majority of deaths (63%). In almost all age classes proportionally more men than women had died at follow-up; there was a significant difference in the 60–69 year group (men 61.6%, women 46.2%). In comparison with the general population, excess mortality ranged from 2.1 to 1.0, decreasing with age at onset without significant differences between men and women. Excess mortality was present in most age classes and was evident within the first year after diagnosis. Current life-table analysis confirmed the shortened life expectancy of the diabetics. The lower lifeexpectancy of noninsul-independent diabetics may not be due to hyperglycaemia alone but probably also involves a variety of atherogenic risk factors.</p>
<p>Diabetes mellitus accelerates the clinical course of atherosclerosis and increases both cardiovascular morbidity and mortality Citation. Besides hypertension and dyslipidemia, diabetes is a well-known independent risk factor for coronary heart disease and ischemic stroke, particularly atherothrombotic infarction and lacunes Citation. In a classical autopsy study of acute cerebrovascular accidents in diabetes, cerebral small-vessel disease was 2.5-times more frequent in diabetes Citation. In clinical series of lacunar infarctions, the incidence of diabetes varied between 11 and 29% Citation. Diabetes is not only an independent risk factor for lacunar infarction, especially in patients with multiple lacunar infarcts Citation, but the presence of diabetes is also associated with worse functional recovery in these patients Citation. In a recent study, diabetes and hypertension were independent factors .</p>
<p>Your treatment plan is likely to require adjustment over time. Insulin resistance increases with age. And the insulin-producing cells in the pancreas may wear out as the pancreas tries to keep up with the body&#39;s extra insulin needs.</p>
<p>After the first few years, the majority of people with type 2 diabetes require more than one medicine to keep their blood sugar controlled.</p>
<p>The prognosis in people with type 2 diabetes varies. It depends on how well an individual modifies his or her risk of complications. Heart attack, stroke, and kidney disease can result in premature death. Disability due to blindness, amputation, heart disease, stroke, and nerve damage may occur. Some people with type 2 diabetes become dependent on dialysis treatments or require a kidney transplant because of kidney failure.</p>
<h3 id="prognosis-of-diabetes-insipidus">Prognosis of diabetes insipidus</h3>
<p>Diabetes insipidus (DI) is a rare disorder that differs greatly from the famili­ar type 2 and type 1 diabetes. DI happens when your body lacks enough hormones to signal to your kidneys to hang on to the right amount of water. As a result, your body loses too much water through your urine. That makes you severely thirsty. The name of the condition comes from the word “insipid,” to describe the watery pee. DI is also called water diabetes.</p>
<p>Diabetes insipidus usually doesn’t cause serious problems. Adults rarely die from it as long as they drink enough water. But the risk of death is higher for infants, seniors, and those who have mental illnesses. That may be because they have trouble recognizing their thirst, or they can’t do anything about it.</p>
<p>The average person gets rid of 1-2 quarts of urine per day. People with DI can pee 3-20 quarts a day. This condition is called polyuria. The huge output of urine can make you dangerously dehydrated. It also can knock out the balance of electrolytes sodium and potassium that you need for your nerves to work well.</p>
<p>There are four types of diabetes insipidus. Each can have different causes, treatments, and long-term outlook. In most cases, you can manage the condition well with your doctor’s care.­</p>
<p><strong>Central Diabetes Insipidus*</strong>
This is when your body doesn’t make enough of a hormone called vasopressin. You need it to keep the amount of fluids in your body in balance.</p>
<p>A common cause behind central DI is head injury, specifically damage to the part of the brain that makes vasopressin or to the nearby pituitary gland, where the hormone is stored.
That can happen after an infection, surgery, tumor, or for other reasons.
Some babies can be born with central DI because of genetic disorders.
A low-sodium (salt) diet may be enough to treat some mild or moderate cases of central diabetes insipidus. A main first goal of treatment is to help you get more sleep that’s interrupted by repeated trips to the bathroom.</p>
<p>For others, a man-made hormone called desmopressin works well to replace or boost your missing vasopressin. Desmopressin pills are the preferred form of treatment, although the hormone can be taken as a shot or nasal spray too. While using desmopressin, you must take the correct dose and regulate your fluid intake. Too many fluids can cause headaches, dizziness, bloating, and dangerously low sodium levels. The treatment can control your symptoms like dehydration, weight loss, high fevers, or crankiness. But it isn’t a cure.</p>
<p><strong>Nephrogenic Diabetes Insipidus</strong></p>
<p>You can be born with this condition or get it later in life. Newborns may not get enough nutrition to grow and thrive. Their bladder or kidneys can get infected often. Over time, that can cause the kidneys to fail. But with the right treatment, babies with nephrogenic DI can live a normal life span with few complications.
If your nephrogenic DI wasn’t hereditary, it may have been caused by:</p>
<ul>
<li>Kidney disease</li>
<li>Certain medications, including lithium, the antiviral drug foscarnet, and the antipsychotic drug clozapine</li>
<li>Too much calcium in the blood (hypercalcemia)</li>
<li>Too low blood levels of potassium (hypokalemia)</li>
<li>Blockages in the urinary tract</li>
</ul>
<p>Addressing the root causes of your nephrogenic DI can give you a good prognosis and sometimes even make the condition go away. Diuretics, aspirin, or ibuprofen may help limit how much you pee or help your kidneys flush out fluids from your body.</p>
<p><strong>Dipsogenic Diabetes Insipidus</strong>
Researchers have not found a good treatment for this condition. It can result from an injury or a flaw in the brain’s hypothalamus, which controls thirst. Certain drugs or mental illnesses also can cause it. Dipsogenic DI can make you drink uncontrollably to quench your thirst.</p>
<p>Treating any mental disorder that’s causing it may help. For others, ice chips, sprays, and mouthwashes may ease the dry mouth and the thirst. One possible danger is water intoxication, which can be deadly.</p>
<p><strong>Gestational Diabetes Insipidus</strong>
This can happen to many women during the last 3 months of pregnancy. Common symptoms include extreme thirst and urination. Gestational DI can be caused by hormonal changes or because an enzyme in the womb breaks down vasopressin, which helps regulate your body fluids.</p>
<p>Carrying two or more babies raises your chances for getting it. But any problems tend to be mild, and they usually go away within weeks after delivery.</p>
<p>For all forms of diabetes insipidus, the biggest concerns are dehydration and electrolyte imbalances. Keep a watch for symptoms of those problems, including: Big thirst, Dry mouth, lips, and skin, Tiredness or lightheadedness, Urinating often at night, Cramps or nausea, Dark or little urine, Shallow or fast breathing,Low blood pressure.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Diabetes mellitus and diabetes insipidus, while sharing a common name, differ significantly in origin, pathophysiology, symptoms, complications, diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis. Diabetes mellitus, primarily characterized by hyperglycemia, results from insulin deficiency or resistance, leading to chronic complications such as cardiovascular disease, neuropathy, and nephropathy. In contrast, diabetes insipidus is marked by an inability to concentrate urine due to a deficiency of antidiuretic hormone (ADH) or renal insensitivity to ADH, causing excessive urination and thirst without directly affecting blood glucose levels.</p>
<p>Understanding the distinctions between these two conditions is crucial for proper diagnosis and treatment. While diabetes mellitus management focuses on regulating blood sugar levels through lifestyle modifications, medications, and insulin therapy, diabetes insipidus treatment aims to address the underlying cause and manage fluid balance through ADH replacement or medications that enhance its effect.</p>
<p>Health care professionals must be adept at differentiating between these conditions to provide accurate and effective care. Prognosis varies significantly, with diabetes mellitus requiring lifelong management to prevent severe complications, whereas diabetes insipidus, with appropriate treatment, can often be managed effectively with a relatively normal life expectancy.</p>
<p>In conclusion, although diabetes mellitus and diabetes insipidus share a name and some superficial similarities, they are fundamentally different diseases requiring distinct approaches to diagnosis, treatment, and long-term management.</p>
