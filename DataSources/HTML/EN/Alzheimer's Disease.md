<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>Alzheimer&#39;s is one kind of progressive neurologic disorder which mainly contributes to problems in memory, thinking, and behavior. It accounts for 60-80% of all cases of dementia in elderly people, making it one of the most common kinds of dementia among the elderly. The disease is named after Dr. Alois Alzheimer, who first described it in 1906 following the post-mortem analysis of changes in the brain tissue of a woman who died from an unusual mental illness.</p>
<p>It&#39;s a disorder characterized by the deposition of amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles in the brain and, eventually, killing the brain cells. This will finally lead to progressive loss of cognitive functions, where patients have a hard time performing daily activities. The symptoms and strategies for care should be learnt in order to understand how to deal with the disease and care for your loved one.</p>

<h2 id="symptoms-of-alzheimer-s-disease">Symptoms of Alzheimer&#39;s Disease</h2>
<h3 id="early-symptoms">Early Symptoms</h3>
<p>1) #### Significant Memory Loss</p>
<p>Forgetting one&#39;s personal history, important dates, and recent experiences. During the beginning of memory loss, changes can be very subtle. It involves repetitive questioning for the same information, increasingly relying on memory aids, or simply forgetting important dates, appointments, and events.</p>
<p>2) #### Difficulty Planning and Solving Problems
Difficulty following plans, working with numbers, and solving familiar problems—difficulty following a familiar recipe, keeping track of monthly bills, concentration, and doing things that take much longer than usual.</p>
<p>3) #### Confusion with Time or Place
Loss of track of dates, seasons, time passage. An individual with Alzheimer&#39;s will forget where they are or how they got there. In addition, such people forget things that are not immediately happening and become disoriented about their place or surroundings than before.</p>
<p>4) #### Trouble Understanding Visual Images and Spatial Relationships
It can make reading quite difficult, estimation of distances—a problem in driving—and judging colour or contrast, which may also contribute to the number of falls or accidents. It may be hard to recognize faces or common objects.</p>
<p>5) #### New Problems with Words in Speaking or Writing
Difficulty in vocabulary, searching for the right word, or following or joining in a conversation. This can include such past behaviors as breaking off in mid-conversation and not knowing how to continue. Others include repetition and difficulty naming objects or people.</p>
<p>6) #### Misplacing Things and Losing the Ability to Retrace Steps
Putting things in inappropriate places and then being unable to find them. The patient tends to accuse others of concealing things or even stealing their items. This becomes increasingly common and frustrating, increasing anxiety.</p>
<p>7) #### Decreased or Poor Judgment
Making bad decisions, for instance, to give telemarketers massive amounts of money. One may become increasingly indifferent to their own looks or hygiene. They also show poor judgment with money and in social situations.</p>
<p>8) #### Withdrawal from Work or Social Activities
This can lead to situations of social withdrawal and result in isolation and depression when there is embarrassment in situations of a social nature, whether it is a hobby or work project, because of the difficulty of keeping up on the conversation or activity.</p>
<p>9) #### Changes in Mood and Personality
Mood swings, confusion, suspiciousness, depression, fear, anxiety. Easily upset at home, with friends, or in places where they are out of their comfort zone. Personality changes can be especially disturbing for the patient and their families.</p>

<h3 id="moderate-symptoms">Moderate Symptoms</h3>
<p>As Alzheimer&#39;s disease progresses, symptoms become more pronounced and can include:</p>
<p>1) #### Increased Memory Loss and Confusion</p>
<p>The memory loss worsens, and a person suffering from this disease is not able to recognize his family members, friends, etc. They may forget important personal information, such as the address or telephone number.</p>
<p>2) #### Difficulty with Language and Communication
Increasing language difficulties, including use of vocabulary, fluency, and the ability to make sense in constructing sentences. They may also have trouble understanding spoken or written language.</p>
<p>3) #### Behavioral and Psychological Symptoms
This can include agitation, aggression, hallucinations, delusions, and other symptoms that can be very upsetting and very difficult to control.</p>
<p>4) #### Physical Coordination and Movement
A decrease in physical abilities, trouble with coordination, and fine motor skills. This can lead to difficulty with walking, maintaining balance, and increased risk of falls.</p>
<p>5) #### Changes in Sleep Patterns
Changes in sleep patterns; insomnia, somnolence, and restlessness at night. This may not only disturb the patient&#39;s sleep but also affect the family caregivers&#39;.</p>
<p>6) #### Increased Dependence on Caregivers
Increased dependency on their caregivers for bathing, dressing, eating, and self-care toiletting. Caregivers may be required to watch the patients constantly to ensure that they are protected from injury.</p>
<h3 id="severe-symptoms">Severe Symptoms</h3>
<p>In the advanced stage, the Alzheimer&#39;s patient becomes bedridden and is unable to respond to their surroundings, communicate, or perform basic activities. The symptoms include:</p>
<p>1) #### Severe Memory Loss
Inability to recognize close relations or friends. They develop a profound loss of memory, and even the identity of self is not recallable.</p>
<p>2) #### Inability to Communicate Verbally</p>
<p>Inability to speak or understand language; the patient is only able to groan, moan, or make other sounds.</p>
<p>3) #### Difficulty Swallowing and Eating</p>
<p>Difficulty swallowing, leading to weight loss, dehydration, and malnutrition. It could also result in a higher than usual risk of aspiration pneumonia.</p>
<p>4) #### Loss of Bladder and Bowel Control
Incontinence is common, and the individual often requires full-time care, needing assistance with toileting.</p>
<p>5) #### Increased Risk of Infections
Decreased resistance and loss of mobility increase the risk of infections, such as pneumonia and urinary tract infections.</p>
<p>6) #### Total Dependence on Caregivers
Advanced Stage: Total dependence of the person on the caregiver for all personal care needs; round-the-clock care and supervision are required for people in this stage.</p>

<h2 id="diagnosis-of-alzheimer-s-disease">Diagnosis of Alzheimer&#39;s Disease</h2>
<h3 id="medical-history-and-physical-examination">Medical History and Physical Examination</h3>
<p>The diagnosis of Alzheimer&#39;s disease incorporates an entire medical history and physical examination. A doctor will ask about symptoms, family history, and other medical conditions. He may also conduct some tests that would help determine memory, problem-solving abilities, attention counting, and language.</p>
<h3 id="neuropsychological-testing">Neuropsychological Testing</h3>
<p>Neuropsychological tests portray an assessment of detailed cognitive functions, including memory, language, attention, and problem-solving. All these tests help in identifying specific areas where there is a deficit in cognitive functions and make a differential diagnosis for Alzheimer&#39;s disease from other dementia syndromes.</p>
<h3 id="brain-imaging">Brain Imaging</h3>
<p>Methods for imaging, such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computed tomography (CT) scans, have been used to determine changes in brain structure. Imaging in this research might show brain atrophy, which is the process of the brain getting smaller, and may rule out other factors that might show similar symptoms, such as brain tumors or strokes.</p>
<h3 id="biomarker-testing">Biomarker Testing</h3>
<p>Biomarker tests measure the cerebrospinal fluid or blood for specific proteins related to Alzheimer&#39;s disease, such as amyloid-beta and tau. This can help confirm a diagnosis and chart the progress of the disease.</p>
<h3 id="genetic-testing">Genetic Testing</h3>
<p>Genetic testing can detect some genes responsible for Alzheimer&#39;s disease—for example, APOE-e4—but their presence does not mean that the bearer will acquire the illness; it serves to increase the risk.</p>
<h3 id="differential-diagnosis">Differential Diagnosis</h3>
<p>Differential diagnosis rules out all the other diseases that may have a similar way of manifestation and presentation of symptoms, such as other dementias, depression, or vitamin deficiencies. It helps in giving an appropriate diagnosis for Alzheimer&#39;s disease and administering proper treatment and care.</p>
