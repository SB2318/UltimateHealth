# Music with self care

Music has been a part of human culture since time out of mind and is interlinked in our lives, right from feelings to the mental development and meditation of a human being. This paper discusses the deep effects music has on mental health: how it can shape emotional experiences, contribute to mental development, and provide support in meditation practices.


## The Emotional Impact of Music

In essence, it means that fairly often, musicians have better working memory, where one is able to retain information over a short period and manipulate it if need be. The ability to work out temporary information is quite useful in academics and everyday life.

#### Research: The Mozart Effect
