## About

People may experience loneliness at times, but long-term or severe loneliness may negatively affect health and well-being. Loneliness can affect people of all ages. Seeking support and connection may help resolve feelings of loneliness.
People may experience emotional distress if their inherent companionship and intimacy needs are not met.

Loneliness may occur if people feel a gap between the quantity or quality of relationships they desire and their actual social connections.
Loneliness is a perceived state of being alone that causes emotional unease or distress.

Chronic loneliness may lead to mental and physical health issues. Connecting with others and practicing self-care may help. People can seek help for loneliness by talking with a healthcare professional.

Some psychologists view loneliness as part of the human condition that, although painful, may also offer renewal and increased self-awareness.

If people are experiencing loneliness, they may feelTrusted Source:

   - disconnected from other people
   - isolated from other people
   - as though nobody understands them
   - as though they have nobody to turn to or talk with
   - sad

Physical symptoms may include changes in:

   - focus or concentration
   - appetite
   - sleep
   - energy levels

 Loneliness is a universal human emotion that is both complex and unique to each individual. Because it has no single common cause, preventing and treating this potentially damaging state of mind can vary dramatically.

For example, a lonely child who struggles to make friends at school has different needs than a lonely older adult whose spouse has recently died.

Researchers suggest that loneliness is associated with social isolation, poor social skills, introversion, and depression.4

Loneliness, according to many experts, is not necessarily about being alone. Instead, if you feel alone and isolated, then that is how loneliness plays into your state of mind.

For example, a college freshman might feel lonely despite being surrounded by roommates and other peers. A soldier beginning their military career might feel lonely after being deployed to a foreign country, despite being constantly surrounded by other troop members.

Some researchersTrusted Source suggest that social media use, which may replace face-to-face contact, may contribute to loneliness. Others suggest that social media may allow people to form new relationships or connect with people they already know.

In older adults, loneliness may be due to social isolation, which may result fromTrusted Source:

   ~ living alone

Certain life events may make people feel lonely, such as:

   ~ bereavement
   ~ the end of a relationship
   ~ a job loss or job change
   ~ retirement
   ~ the start of college
   ~ mental health issues

 Contributing factors to loneliness include situational variables, such as physical isolation, moving to a new location, and divorce.5 The death of someone significant in a person's life can also lead to feelings of loneliness.

Loneliness can also be attributed to internal factors such as low self-esteem. People who lack confidence in themselves often believe that they are unworthy of the attention or regard of other people, which can lead to isolation and chronic loneliness.

Personality factors may also play a role.Introverts, for example, might be less likely to cultivate and seek social connections, which can contribute to feelings of isolation and loneliness.
